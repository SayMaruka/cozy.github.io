the Cozy registry according to some options. Requirements \u00b6 Node.js version 8 or higher; Install \u00b6 yarn add --dev cozy-app-publish Registry documentation \u00b6 You can find more information about the registry and how to prepare an application to be published in the official registry documentation . Usage via Travis CI (recommended) \u00b6 First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using the Travis CI workflow: # publish it, REGISTRY_TOKEN should be # encrypted and provided via Travis CI environment # BUILD_COMMIT is your last build commit hash (git rev-parse build) yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-commit $BUILD_COMMIT Manual usage (not recommended) \u00b6 First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using: yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9 Options \u00b6 --token <editor-token> (required) \u00b6 The registry editor token. This token must match the editor name and is provided by Cozy Cloud (with the name) in order to use the registry. --build-dir <relative-path> \u00b6 The path to the build folder, relative to the current directory. Since the \u2018standard\u2019 Cozy application builds in the build/ folder, build is the default value. This folder is mainly used to read the application manifest during publishing. --build-url <url> \u00b6 For now, the registry a build archive (.tar.gz file) from an external link to be used in the cozy-stack. In the travis script, this url is computed using the Github trick to get archives from a commit url (but it\u2019s overwritten if provided by this option). For the manual script, we have to provide it. --build-commit <commit-hash> \u00b6 Using the travis mode, the archive tarball URL is computed using github and the build commit hash. If you are not on your build branch to publish, you can specify the correct build commit hash using this parameter. --manual-version <version> (required for manual usage only) \u00b6 In the manual mode, we don\u2019t have a way to compute the version like in the Travis mode for example. So we have to provide it using this option. --prepublish <script_path> \u00b6 Specify custom prepublish hook to manage how the app archive is generated and uploaded. The script must export a asynchronous function which has the following signature: module . exports = async ({ appBuildUrl , appSlug , appType , appVersion , buildCommit , registryUrl , registryEditor , registryToken , spaceName }) => { // ... } This function must return an object containing the same options given as parameter, which can have been updated. For example, you may specifiy a new appBuildUrl in the hook. Here\u2019s a description of the different options: Options Description appBuildUrl The url where the build can be retrieved. For example, http://github.com/cozy/cozy-foo/archives/cozy-foo.tar.gz appSlug The slug of the application, as defined in the manifest. Should not be mutated appType webapp or konnector appVersion App version, as defined in the manifest. Should not be mutated. buildCommit sha of the commit, should not be mutated. registryUrl URL of the Cozy registry, should not be mutated. registryEditor Editor as it appears in the Cozy registry. registryToken Registry Token. See registry documentation . Should not be mutated. spaceName Space name in the Cozy registry. --postpublish <script_path> \u00b6 Works exactly like the prepublish option, but will be executed after the publication. Multiple hooks and built-in hooks \u00b6 You can specify more than one hook by separating them with a , : cozy-app-publish --prepublish <hook_name>,<other_hook_name> Some hooks are shipped with cozy-app-publish and can be used by specifying their name: cozy-app-publish --prepublish <builtin_hook_name> Downcloud prepublish hook \u00b6 cozy-app-publish --prepublish downcloud This hook allows to upload the app to our downcloud server and sets the appBuildUrl accordingly. In order to upload files to our downcloud server, you will need to generate a new pair of RSA keys, add the private key to your ssh-agent and make sure the corresponding public key is present on the downcloud server. Here\u2019s how to do it: Generate a new key pair with ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa_downcloud_myapp -C downcloud_myapp_deploy . Communicate the public key to someone who can deposit it on the downcloud server. If you\u2019re running things locally, you\u2019ll want to run ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp to add it to your ssh-agent. If you\u2019re planing to run this cozy-app-publish on Travis, you\u2019ll want to encrypt that file first . Run travis encrypt-file id_rsa_downcloud_myapp and copy the output. To add the key to Travis\u2019s ssh-agent, add the following lines in the before_install section of your .travis.yml , but don\u2019t forget to paste the output of travis encrypt-file where it\u2019s needed. - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then PASTE_TRAVIS_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT_HERE; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then chmod 600 id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi We recommend changing the path used for the private key. You can change the -out argument of the command output by travis encrypt-file and the corresponding path\u2019s in the commands above. /tmp/id_rsa_downcloud_myapp is a good place to store this key. Finally, secure the private key . If you\u2019re using Travis, the key is now stored by Travis so you should delete your local copy. If you\u2019re running things on your machine, make sure the private key doesn\u2019t end up in version control. Rundeck postpublish hook \u00b6 cozy-app-publish --postpublish rundeck Deploys the app on rundeck. This hook requires several variables to be set as environment variables: RUNDECK_TOKEN : the token to use to interact with the Rundeck API. To obtain such a token, ask someone that has admin privileges on the rundeck server. TARGETS_DEV : a comma-separated list of instances to deploy the app on, on the dev channel. TARGETS_BETA : a comma-separated list of instances to deploy the app on, on the beta channel. TARGETS_STABLE : a comma-separated list of instances to deploy the app on, on the stable channel. Mattermost postpublish hook \u00b6 cozy-app-publish --postpublish mattermost Sends a message to a mattermost channel to notify of the app\u2019s deployment. Requires the following options: MATTERMOST_HOOK_URL : You will need to set up a new Incoming Hook . MATTERMOST_CHANNEL : The name of the channel messages will be posted to. --registry-url <url> \u00b6 The url of the registry, by default it will be https://staging-apps-registry.cozycloud.cc. --space <space-name> \u00b6 Use this options to provide a specific space name of the registry to publish the application in. By default it will be published in the default space. --verbose \u00b6 To print more logs when using tool (useful for debug). Recommended workflow \u00b6 Day to day \u00b6 Development is done on feature branches that are merged into master , once they are complete. Every time someone commits on master , a new archive is created and uploaded on Downcloud and it is then deployed on a test instance with Rundeck. Release workflow \u00b6 A new branch is created from the current state of master . Let\u2019s say we want to deploy version 1.0.0 of the app. The only type of commits allowed on this release branch are bug fixes. Every time one or more bugs are fixed and the version is considered for release, the latest commit is tagged with a prerelease version number, eg. 1.0.0-beta.1 , 1.0.0-beta.2 , etc\u2026 Each of these prereleases is automatically uploaded on downcloud and deployed on instances that are on the beta channel. Once the branch is deemed ready for release, the last commit is tagged with the final version \u2014 1.0.0 in our example. It is then, again, uploaded on downcloud, published on the registry and deployed on specific instances as needed. The release branch is merged back into master so that all the bugfixes aren\u2019t lost.","title":"Publish on the store (app-publish)"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#cozy-app-publish","text":"","title":"Cozy App Publish"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#whats-cozy-app-publish","text":"cozy-app-publish is a command line tool that publish a Cozy application to the Cozy registry according to some options.","title":"What's cozy-app-publish?"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#requirements","text":"Node.js version 8 or higher;","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#install","text":"yarn add --dev cozy-app-publish","title":"Install"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#registry-documentation","text":"You can find more information about the registry and how to prepare an application to be published in the official registry documentation .","title":"Registry documentation"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#usage-via-travis-ci-recommended","text":"First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using the Travis CI workflow: # publish it, REGISTRY_TOKEN should be # encrypted and provided via Travis CI environment # BUILD_COMMIT is your last build commit hash (git rev-parse build) yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-commit $BUILD_COMMIT","title":"Usage via Travis CI (recommended)"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#manual-usage-not-recommended","text":"First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using: yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9","title":"Manual usage (not recommended)"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#options","text":"","title":"Options"},{"location":"cozy-app-publish/#-token-lteditor-tokengt-required","text":"The registry editor token.

You also must have redis and an OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) up and running. You can follow install instructions on the official website 1) Install and configure the local cozy-apps-registry \u00b6 Since this is a golang project, you can install it using go with the followed command: go get -u github.com/cozy/cozy-apps-registry cd $GOPATH /src/github.com/cozy/cozy-apps-registry/ Then you will need a session secret key to run the registry (this key will be store in the sessionsecret.key file of your working directory) using a password: cozy-apps-registry gen-session-secret --passphrase sessionsecret.key This password is important, you will need it to run the cozy-apps-registry again later. If you lose it, you will have to start again these steps. 2) Configure the registry with cozy-registry.yml \u00b6 Before running the registry, you have to configure it correctly. Don\u2019t worry, here is the yaml file to copy and paste in your cozy-registry.yml (should be in the root folder of cozy-apps-registry/ ): :bulb: You can find an example of this configuration file at the root of the directory. # server host (serve command) - flag --host host : \"localhost\" # server port (serve command) - flag --port port : 8081 couchdb : # CouchDB server url - flag --couchdb-url url : http://localhost:5984 # CouchDB user - flag --couchdb-user user : '' # CouchDB password - flag --couchdb-password password : '' # CouchDB prefix for the registries databases - flag --couchdb-prefix prefix : registry1 swift : # Swift auth URL (provided by keystone) auth_url : http://172.28.128.3/identity/v3 # Swift username username : admin # Swift password api_key : secret # Endpoint type (public/admin/internal) endpointy_type : public # Project name tenant : demo # Swift domain domain : default # Path to the session secret file containing the master secret to generate # session token. # # Should be generated with the \"gen-session-secret\" command. session-secret : sessionsecret.key Feel free to change it if some configurations change in your case (the couchdb user, the server parameters or the databases prefix for example). Notices: Here the generated session token (step 1) is stored in the sessionsecret.key file of the working directory, this is so the value of the property session-secret at the end of the configuration file. By default, the local couchdb allow all admin accesses without creating users, so there is no user and password here. But if an admin user has been created, you have to use the properties user and password in the couchdb part to provide these informations. It\u2019s also possible to use env variables for configuration. You can take the key from the configuration file and add the COZY_REGISTRY prefix. For example, you can run: COZY_REGISTRY_PORT = 8081 cozy-apps-registry serve There is also the REGISTRY_SESSION_PASS env variable for the password for the session secret. 3) Run the registry to serve the apps \u00b6 Run the registry using this followed command (here our configuration file is a cozy-registry.yml in the current working directory): cozy-apps-registry serve -c cozy-registry.yml At this step, you should have a cozy-apps-registry running and ready for the development. If you runnig the registry for the first time you can see the next steps to create a new editor and to configure your local cozy-stack to run with this new registry. The -c options is always mandatory if you want to specify a config file like here. 4) Create an editor \u00b6 This step is required to submit new applications in the registry. In another terminal, run these commands to create an editor (the one that will submit the application(s)) and generate an access token: cozy-apps-registry add-editor Cozy -c cozy-registry.yml cozy-apps-registry gen-token --master Cozy -c cozy-registry.yml Here we go, you have now an registry ready and running on the 8081 port. The -c options is always mandatory if you want to specify a config file like here. 5) Configure cozy-stack with the registry \u00b6 On the cozy-stack , you have to add the new registry in the stack configuration file cozy.yaml (registries property): ... registries : default : - http://localhost:8081/ ... Now restart your local cozy-stack to take this new configuration in consideration (stop and run again cozy-stack serve ) and you\u2019re ready to work with the cozy-apps-registry ! Publish your application on the registry \u00b6 If you need more details about the registry you can go to the official registry documentation :warning: Important: In this whole documentation, by the term application , we mean a web application or a konnector. Indeed, for the registry, all entities are applications and they can be either webapp or konnector type. 1) Prepare your application \u00b6 To be publishable, your application requires some informations in its manifest.webapp , the manifest of a Cozy application. You can find an example of manifest for an application in Cozy-Drive and one for a konnector in cozy-konnector-trainline . Most properties are common to both applications and konnectors but platforms, screenshots, services, routes and intents are only used in applications. Properties oauth, data_types, doctypes, fields, frequency, language, messages, parameters, time_interval, uuid and vendor_link ar only used in konnectors. Properties meaning (reference) \u00b6 Here are all properties meaning for the manifest file (for webapp and konnectors) sorted alphabetically: Field Description aggregator Object containing aggregator data. Typically { accountId: 'aggregator-service' } . categories array of categories for your apps (see authorized categories), it will be ['others'] by default if empty data_types (konnector specific) Array of the data type the konnector will manage developer name and url for the developer editor the editor\u2019s name to display on the cozy-bar ( REQUIRED ) fields (konnector specific) JSON object describing the fields need by the konnector ( except folder path ). Used to generate a form. See below folders (konnector specific) A list of folders required by the konnector to store files according to datatype (see the specific documentation below ) frequency (konnector specific) A human readable value between monthly , weekly , daily , indicating the interval of time between two runs of the konnector. Default: weekly . icon path to the icon for the home (path in the build) intents (application specific) a list of intents provided by this app (see cozy-stack intents doc for more details) langs Languages available in your app (can be different from locales) language (konnector specific) the konnector development language used (ex: node ) license the SPDX license identifier locales an object with language slug as property, each name property is an object of localized informations (see the second part below) manifest_version The current manifest version used. This is a versioning for the manifest and allow better retrocompatiblity when processing app manifest messages (konnector specific) Array of message identifiers, which can be used by application to display information at known areas. See example below . name the name to display on the home ( REQUIRED ) name_prefix the prefix to display with the name oauth (konnector specific) JSON object containing oAuth information, like scope . If a manifest provides an oauth property, it is considered as an OAuth konnector. Note: scope can be a string or an array. If it is an array, its values will be joined with a space. A false or null value in scope will remove any scope parameter in the request sent to the oauth provider. parameters (konnector specific) Additional parameters which should be passed to the konnector. Used for example for bank konnectors to pass a bankId parameter. partnership an object to provide informations (to display in the Store for example) about a partnership related to the application ( icon description , name and domain ). It can also be used to trigger alternative konnector connection policies for some vendors (see the budget-insight konnector policy in cozy-harvest ). permissions a map of permissions needed by the app (see see cozy-stack permissions doc for more details) platforms (application specific) List of objects for platform native applications. For now there are only two properties: type (i.e. 'ios' or 'linux' ) and the optional url to reach this application page. routes (application specific) a map of routes for the app (see cozy-stack routes doc for more details) ( REQUIRED ) screenshots an array of paths to the screenshots of the application (paths in the build) services (application specific) a map of the services associated with the app (see cozy-stack services doc for more details) slug the default slug that should never change (alpha-numeric lowercase) ( REQUIRED ) source where the files of the app can be downloaded (by default it will look for the branch build ) tags a list a tags describing your application and features (useful for indexing and search) terms an object defining properties for terms that need to be displayed/accepted by the user when installing the application ( more-info-below ) time_interval (konnector specific) By defaults, konnector triggers are scheduled randomly between 00:00 AM and 05:00 AM. Those two values can be overwritten thanks to this property, by passing an array containing two values: first is the interval start hour, second is the interval end hour. Example: [15, 21] will randomly schedule the konnector trigger between 15:00 (03:00 PM) and 21:00 (09:00 PM). The time zone used is GMT. type type of application ( konnector or webapp ) ( REQUIRED ) version the current version number ( REQUIRED ) vendor_link (konnector specific) URL to editor or service website Notices: All images paths ( icon , partnership.icon and screenshots ) should be relative to the build directory. For example, here, the icon.svg is stored in the build root directory and all screenshots are store in a folder screenshots in the build directory. Therefore, if you use a bundler (like webpack) be sure to know exactly where the bundler will store these assets in the build directory (and change it in the manifest if needed). All properties in locales objects will override the matched property of the main manifest.webapp body, if a property is not found in locales it will fallback to the main body one. We use to have the en locale as default one if the one wanted by the user doesn\u2019t exist. Be sure to have, at least, that locale complete with the name and all descriptions. In your build files, this manifest.webapp file must be at the root. Translated manifest fields \u00b6 Here are the properties that you can override using locales (we recommand to automatically build these properties according to your locales files if you\u2019re using a translating tool like transifex ): name , the app\u2019s name short_description , short description of what the app do long_description , longer and more complete description of the app behaviour changes , description of your new version of the konnector or all changes since the last version fields , An object containing translations for fields. screenshots folders { \"fields\" : { \"email\" : { \"type\" : \"email\" } }, \"locales\" : { \"en\" : { \"short_description\" : \"Collect your Orange's bills\" , \"fields\" : { \"email\" : { \"label\" : \"Identifier (your email)\" } } }, \"fr\" : { \"short_description\" : \"R\u00e9cup\u00e8re vos factures Orange\" , \"fields\" : { \"email\" : { \"label\" : \"Identifiant (votre adresse mail)\" } } } } } Application terms \u00b6 You can provide a related terms property if you want to display and make the user accept some terms (ToS for example) just before installing the application. Here are all properties allowed and used: url , the URL of the terms/contract to redirect the user to ( REQUIRED ) version : A specific version of the terms, we need it handle terms updates and ask the user again to accept the update. The special characters [*+~.()'\"!:@] are not allowed here. ( REQUIRED ) id : An id for the terms. When accepting terms, we store in io.cozy.terms , a document containing the id and version so that we know which terms have been accepted, and show the user a modal if the terms have not been accepted yet. The special characters [*+~.()'\"!:@] are not allowed here. ( REQUIRED ) Konnectors folders handling \u00b6 The folders property is a list of objects with these following properties: defaultDir : ( REQUIRED ) The default root directory of your folder. In this folder will automatically be created a subfolder with the konnector name and into this latter a subfolder with the account name to store the related files. Here you can use some variables in the path like the following: $administrative : Folder which will receive all administrative related files (bills, contracts, invoices\u2026) $photos : Folder which will receive all photos $konnector : The name of the konnector :warning: All paths provided using defaultDir will be the root directory, not the final folder which will receive the files. For example, if you set $photos , the final folder will be $photos/$konnector/$account in order to keep them always sorted by konnectors and accounts. Konnectors fields property \u00b6 The fields property is a JSON object describing the input fields needed to generate the konnector\u2019s configuration form. A typical example will be: { \"fields\" : { \"identifier\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, \"secret\" : { \"type\" : \"password\" } } } The keys of the fields object are the name/id of the fields. They will be passed as parameters to the konnector at every run. Each fields may also have the following properties: Property Description identifier (Boolean) indicating if the field is the main identifier. By default, the login field is the identifier. Default value is false and there can be only one identifier advanced Indicates if the field should be displayed in the \u201cadvanced\u201d area of the form (default: false ) default Default value. It can a string for a text field, or an object for a select field ( \"default\": {\"value\": \"foo\",\"name\": \"bar\"}, ) description Field description, as a locale key. label Predefined label. This value must match a locale key provided by Cozy-Home. Example: With label: \"identifier\" , Cozy-Home will use the locale key account.form.label.identifier . Translations for these fields use the locales property in the manifest. max Maximum length of the value (number of characters) min Minimum length of the value (number of characters) options When the field is a dropdown, list of available options pattern Define a regex used to validate the field. isRequired Boolean indicating if the field is required or not (default true ) type Required . Field type from dropdown , email , hidden , password , text , checkbox . Konnectors message property \u00b6 Messages are a common way to provide custom information to display in application. An app like cozy-home should have some specific area to display custom messages provided by the konnector. Example: // The final example will be available after the implementation of the whole mechanism, // but here is the global idea: { installSuccess && < p >{ t ( 'home.konnector.install.success.message' )}</ p > } { installSuccess && konnector . manifest . messages . includes ( 'success_message' ) && < p >{ t ( 'konnector.manifest.locales.messages.success_message' )} } Categories and Data types \u00b6 Categories are slugs from the following list: * energy * insurance * isp * shopping * telecom * transport * banking * health * host_provider * online_services * partners * press * productivity * public_service * social Data types are slugs from the following list: * activity * appointment * bankTransactions * bankAccounts * bill * bloodPressure * calendar * certificate * commit * consumption * contact * contract * courseMaterial * document * event * family * geopoint * heartbeat * home * phonecommunicationlog * podcast * profile * refund * sinister * sleepTime * stepsNumber * temperature * travelDate * tweet * videostream * weight 2) Add a new application in the registry \u00b6 Our official apps registry \u00b6 Official registry URL: https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc In order to use our official repository, you need a token for a specific editor. To do so, contact us directly at the address contact@cozycloud.cc with a mail using the following title prefix: [registry] and provide us these folowing information (not changeable after): - slug of your application - editor name that you want We will provide you with the correct token. Custom registry \u00b6 See the details below to know how to add a new application in a custom cozy-apps-registry instance (local or not). Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - The communication with the registry is done through HTTP requests for now. So we will use the curl command line tool to register our application here. Now you can add your application in the registry. This step is splitted in two septs: - Add a new application (without versions) - Add a version of the application :pushpin: A new application without registered version won\u2019t be displayed by the cozy-store application . To add a new application, you have to do a POST request which all the informations needed to the route registryAddress/registry with registryAddress your registry address (for example here http://localhost:8081 ). Let\u2019s add the Collect application as example: # {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} -> your generated editor access token curl -X \"POST\" \"http://localhost:8081/registry\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Token {{EDITOR_TOKEN}}\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d $'{ \"slug\": \"collect\", \"type\": \"webapp\", \"editor\": \"{{EDITOR}}\" }' Field Description slug your application unique ID type kind of application (it can be only webapp or konnector ) editor Name of the editor matching the {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} :warning: Here the slug is the unique ID of the application in the registry, so it can\u2019t be changed after the application is already registered. 3) Add a new version of a registered application \u00b6 Via cozy-app-publish (highly recommanded) \u00b6 Here we will show the classical way to add a version using the manual mode of cozy-app-publish as reference. But you may need to look at the Automation CI part of this documentation instead. Prequisites : For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. Don\u2019t forget to build your application first (run yarn build ), cozy-app-publish will read the manifest from your build Firstly, install the cozy-app-publish package using yarn or npm : yarn add cozy-app-publish --dev You can also install the package as a global package, but don\u2019t forget to update it frequently Then use it to publish your application, here is an example for collect : yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token {{ EDITOR_TOKEN }} \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9 If you need more information about this tool, you can go to the official cozy-app-publish documentation . Via curl \u00b6 Here we will show the classical way to add a version using curl as reference. But you may need to look at our dedicated tool cozy-app-publish or the Automation CI part of this documentation instead. Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - The communication with the registry is done through HTTP requests for now. So we will use the curl command line tool to register our application here. To add a new application, you have to do a POST request which all the informations needed to the route registryAddress/registry/:appSlug with registryAddress your registry address (for example here http://localhost:8081 ), :appName your application slug (here drive ). Let\u2019s add the version 1.0.1 of the Collect application as example: # {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} -> your generated editor access token curl -X \"POST\" \"http://localhost:8081/registry/collect\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Token {{EDITOR_TOKEN}}\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d $'{ \"url\": \"https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/1.0.1.tar.gz\", \"sha256\": \"96212bf53ab618808da0a92c7b6d9f2867b1f9487ba7c1c29606826b107041b5\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", \"type\": \"webapp\", \"editor\": \"{{EDITOR}}\" }' Field Description url the archive source of your application, it will be downloaded and checked with the sha256 property sha256 the sha256 hash of your source archive matching the archive in url (see the notice below) version version of the application, must match the one in the manifest (see the notice below) type kind of application (it can be only webapp or konnector ) editor Name of the editor matching the {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} :warning: Important notices: The version must match the one in the manifest.webapp file for stable release. For beta (X.X.X-betaX) or dev releases (X.X.X-dev.hash256), the version before the cyphen must match the one in the manifest.webapp . For better integrity, the sha256 provided must match the sha256 of the archive provided in url . If it\u2019s not the case, that will be considered as an error and the version won\u2019t be registered. Spaces & Virtual Spaces \u00b6 Spaces \u00b6 You can divide your applications between several isolated places, called spaces . When an application and its versions are published in a space , they are only reachable in that one (you can consider a space like a entire sub-part of the registry). It is espacially useful for splitting up applications by logical topics. Most of the CLI and API endpoints have a space option. You can refer to the documentation or CLI help to view all available parameters. Create a space \u00b6 Spaces are defined in the config file and are automatically created during registry launching. Add a space entry, followed by your spaces names, and let the registry do the work: spaces : __default__ myspace foospace Remove a space \u00b6 To remove a space, you have to clean all the remaining apps & versions before removing the space entry name. A CLI is available for the job: $ cozy-apps-registry rm-space <your-space> Example: $ cozy-apps-registry rm-space foobar Warning: You are going to remove space foobar and all its applications. This action is irreversible. Please enter the space name to confirm: foobar Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.f26bf2b8db3da459071a074a1367ce36e78bb34c Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.cf1efba4c1b6dd08bb5857f5752790f0d2663d6d Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.0bbd57a6ce50af82cfbefb8c231fbfe04516e742 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.21338229a0c2317dc0f3b94e92b22a367f84c537 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.08ab3624136fb70dc996003aebc3049af51f7438 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.4e9d174a3b01acaf8a44b561455efc3f34871142 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.b2654bf00be393aa611fcbb7f70a8ef671895a84 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.860861868a5dfe294c7120d81fa9feb5387bb57f Removing app2/0.1.9-dev.954dac9e12e080d591cb76591c311611fed1bea9 You can now delete the name from your config file. Virtual Spaces \u00b6 A virtual space is necessarily built over an existing space . It allows to filter by selecting or rejecting applications available on the underlying space. :warning: Please note that a virtual space does not have any database document or associated swift object, it does only enforce filters on a space . Therefore, it is not possible to publish applications or versions on a virtual space . Automation (CI) \u00b6 The following tutorial explains how to connect your continuous integration based on Travis to automatically publish new versions on the apps registry. In this tutorial, we assume: you have a token allowing you to publish applications for your editor : {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} you are working on a repository plugged on travis and named on github myname/cozy-example You first need to add the token to your travis configuration file .travis.yml . To do so, you need the travis utility to encrypt its value. $ travis encrypt REGISTRY_TOKEN ={{ EDITOR_TOKEN }} -r myname/cozy-example --org Please add the following to your .travis.yml file: secure: \"jUAjk..LOOOOONG_ENCRYPTED_STRING.....jdk89=\" Like said, you need to add this block of ciphered data in the .travis.yml (if it\u2019s not already done automatically). This will allow you to use the REGISTRY_TOKEN variable in your deployment script. Then, you can add the publish script in your package.json in order to be used by Travis: ... \"publish:cozy\" : \"git fetch origin ${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build}:${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build} && cozy-app-publish --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN --build-commit $(git rev-parse ${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build})\" ... This script will fetch your last commit from the build branch to publish to the registry. If you push a tag, be sure to wait the last build branch Travis build finished in order to have the real last commit to publish. Finally, you can add this script to your .travis.yml to publish your app using our publishing tool cozy-app-publish during the deploy process: ... before_deploy: - yarn add cozy-app-publish deploy: - provider: script repo: myname/cozy-example skip-cleanup: true script: export DEPLOY_BRANCH=build && yarn deploy && yarn publish:cozy on: branch: master - provider: script repo: myname/cozy-example skip-cleanup: true script: export DEPLOY_BRANCH=build && yarn publish:cozy on: tags: true ... Important notices: A commit push to the branch master will publish your application in the dev channel of the registry. A tag push (Github release) will publish a stable version (ex: 1.0.0 ) or a beta version (ex: 1.0.1-beta2 ) to the registry (automatically handled by the registry). cozy-app-publish will use the github archive URL computing to get the application tarball. If your applicaiton is not on Github, you may need to use the manual mode of the command. Access control and tokens \u00b6 The read-only routes of the registry are all public and do not require any access-control. However routes allowing to create applications and versions have access-control policies associated to them. The registry has two types of access permissions, that are associated to two different tokens: editor tokens : these tokens give access to the publication of new versions on the registry, for a specific editor name, at these conditions: the version\u2019s application must already exist in the registry the version\u2019s application must have the same \u201ceditor\u201d value as the token master tokens : these tokens are allowed to create and register new applications on the registry, and associate them with an existing editor name. They also have the same accesses as the editor tokens. Editor tokens can be specific to one or more applications names that they are allowed to publish. In order to create tokens, the binary offers a gen-token command-line. Here are some examples to illustrates some usages: # Generating tokens # generate an editor token for the editor \"cozy\", for any application $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy # generate an editor token for the editor \"cozy\" expiring after 30 days $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --max-age 30d # generate an editor token for the editor \"cozy\" for application \"collect\" and \"drive\" $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --apps collect,drive # generate a master token associated with the editor \"cozy\" expiring after 30 days $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --master --max-age 30d # Verifying tokens # verify the editor token \"XXX\" for the editor \"cozy\" $ cozy-apps-registry verify-token cozy \"XXX\" # verify the master token \"XXX\" associated with the editor \"cozy\" $ cozy-apps-registry verify-token cozy \"XXX\" --master # Revoking tokens # revoke all editors tokens for the cozy editor $ cozy-apps-registry revoke-tokens cozy # revoke all master tokens associated with the cozy editor $ cozy-apps-registry revoke-tokens cozy --master Maintenance \u00b6 In order to set/unset an application into maintenance mode, the binary offers a maintenance command-line. Here are some examples of how to use it: # Activate maintenance mode for the application 'bank' of space 'myspace' # Available flagged options: # --infra specify a maintenance specific to our infra # --no-manual-exec specify a maintenance disallowing manual execution # --short specify a short maintenance $ cozy-apps-registry maintenance activate bank --space myspace # Deactivate maintenance mode for the application 'bank' of space 'myspace' $ cozy-apps-registry maintenance deactivate bank --space myspace Or using a cURL request and a master token: curl -XPUT \\ -H \"Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN \" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"flag_infra_maintenance\": false,\"flag_short_maintenance\": false,\"flag_disallow_manual_exec\": false,\"messages\": {\"fr\": {\"long_message\": \"Bla bla bla\",\"short_message\": \"Bla\"},\"en\": {\"long_message\": \"Yadi yadi yada\",\"short_message\": \"Yada\"}}}' \\ https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/myspace/registry/maintenance/bank/activate curl -XPUT \\ -H \"Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN \" \\ https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/registry/maintenance/bank/deactivate Import/export \u00b6 CouchDB & Swift can be exported into a single archive with cozy-apps-registry export <dump.tar.gz> . Registry data are exported as below: registry/couchdb/{db}/{uuid}.json : CouchDB document exported as JSON registry/swift/{file/path} : Swift document, with the following tar custom metadata COZY.content-type : associated content type The generated archive can be imported with cozy-apps-registry import -d <dump.tar.gz> . The -d option will drop CouchDB databases and Swift containers related to declared spaces on the registry configuration. Application confidence grade / labelling \u00b6 The confidence grade of an applications can be specified by specifying the data_usage_commitment and data_usage_commitment_by fields of the application document. Possible values for these properties are: data_usage_commitment : specify a technical commitment from the application editor: user_ciphered : technical commitment that the user\u2019s data is encrypted and can only be known by him. user_reserved : commitment that the data is only used for the user, to directly offer its service. none : no commitment data_usage_commitment_by : specify what entity is taking the commitment: cozy : the commitment is taken by cozy editor : the commitment is taken by the application\u2019s editor none : no commitment is taken To do that, a command line and admin API are available, and be used as follow: $ cozy-apps-registry modify-app banks --space my_space --data-usage-commitment user_reserved --data-usage-commitment-by editor Or using a cURL request and a master token: curl -XPATCH \\ -H\"Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN\" \\ -H\"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d'{\"data_usage_commitment\": \"user_reserved\", \"data_usage_commitment_by\": \"editor\"} https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/my_space/registry/banks Universal links \u00b6 The registry can manage Universal links .

This document explains how the matching algorithm works. What are matchings? \u00b6 Matchings are links that can be made between io.cozy.bills and io.cozy.bank.operations documents. For example, if the user ordered something on Amazon, his Amazon connector will import a io.cozy.bills document representing this order, and his banking connector will import a io.cozy.bank.operations representing the bank transaction associated to this order. In banks\u2019 UI, it is used to show a CTA with the transaction on which the user can click to show the linked bill PDF without leaving banks app. The Linker \u00b6 The algorithm is held by the Linker , and more precisely its linkBillsToOperations method. This method takes 3 parameters: An array of io.cozy.bills objects An array of io.cozy.bank.operations objects An options object The options object can contain the following properties: amountLowerDelta : defaults to 0.001 amountUpperDelta : defaults to 0.001 dateLowerDelta : defaults to 15 (days) dateUpperDelta : defaults to 29 (days) These options will determine the default date and amount windows in which a transaction should be to match with a bill. General flow \u00b6 When called, this method will do the following (each part will be explained in details after): Filter bills that are declared as third party payer: these bills have no matching transation since it has been paid by somebody else Then for each bill: Try to find a matching debit transaction (amount < 0) Try to find a matching credit transaction (amount > 0) if the bill is a refund Try to combine bills that didn\u2019t match anything to see if they match something when combined Update transactions that matched in database Finding debit and credit operations for a bill \u00b6 The algorithm is globally the same to find a debit or a credit operation for a bill, but there are some differences at some steps. Each step is explained below. Find neighboring transactions \u00b6 First, we look for transactions that are \u00ab neighbors \u00bb of the bill. It means the ones that fits in the amount and date windows of the bill. The date window is [bill date - dateLowerDelta; bill date + dateUpperDelta] . Where: bill date is bill.date if we are looking for a credit; bill.originalDate with a fallback on bill.date if we are looking for a debit dateLowerDelta is bill.matchingCriterias.dateLowerDelta if it exists, options.dateLowerDelta otherwise dateUpperDelta is bill.matchingCriterias.dateUpperDelta if it exists, options.dateUpperDelta otherwise The amount window is [bill amount - amountLowerDelta; bill amount + amountUpperDelta] . Where: bill amount is bill.groupAmount with a fallback on bill.amount if we are looking for a credit; -bill.originalAmount with a fallback on -bill.amount if we are looking for a debit amountLowerDelta is bill.matchingCriterias.amountLowerDelta if it exists, options.minAmoutDelta otherwise amountUpperDelta is bill.matchingCriterias.amountUpperDelta if it exists, options.maxAmoutDelta otherwise All transactions that matches these two criterias are kept. Apply filters to neighboring transactions \u00b6 There are other filters a transaction must pass to match with a bill. Category \u00b6 Health bills are a little special because they can only match with health transactions. So if the bill is an health bill, we keep only health transactions. Otherwise, we keep all but health transactions. You can pass a allowUncategorized option to the algorithm, in which case uncategorized transactions will also be able to match bills. Reimbursements \u00b6 This filter is applied only if we are looking for a debit transactions. If we try to link a bill as a reimbursement to a debit transaction, we check that the bill\u2019s amount and transaction\u2019s reimbursements sum does not overflows the transaction\u2019s amount. Label regex \u00b6 This filter is applied only if we are looking for a credit transaction or if the bill is not of health type. This filter checks if a transaction matches a regex that is built upon the bill\u2019s properties. Here is how the regexp is built: If the bill has a matchingCriterias.labelRegex property, this is used Otherwise we try to get the brand corresponding to the bill\u2019s vendor in our brands dictionary . If it exists, we use its regexp property Otherwise, we create a regexp containing the bill\u2019s vendor Lastly, if the bill has no vendor, we can\u2019t do anything and the filter will be false for every transaction and the bill will not match any transaction Sort remaining transactions \u00b6 A score is given to the remaining transactions according to their \u00ab distance \u00bb to the bill\u2019s date and amount. The closest one wins and continues through the algorithm. Link bills to debit and credit transactions \u00b6 When transactions were found for a given bill, we need to link the bill to them, either as a bill or as a reimbursement . When a bill matched with a transaction (debit or credit), it is added to the transaction\u2019s bills array. When a bill matched with a debit and a credit transactions, it is also added to the debit transaction\u2019s reimbursements array. A last safety net is applied by checking if adding the bill to the transaction would make the bills sum overflowing the transaction amount or not. It it overflows, the bill is not added. For the bills property, a removed bill will be ignored. But for the reimbursements property, since we don\u2019t fetch the bill because the amount is already present in the transaction, a removed bill will not be ignored. Bills combinations \u00b6 Sometimes, bills need to be combined to match with a debit transaction. It is generally the case for health bills. For example, when your paid multiple medical procedures with a single transaction. It will generate multiple bills for a single debit transaction. In this case, we try to combine bills and find debit transaction for them. This combination process is not required to find debit transaction because in that case the bill\u2019s groupAmount (see io.cozy.bills documentation ) can be used. The bills that are candidates to be combined are the ones that: Didn\u2019t match with a debit transaction Are health costs or are from a vendor that groups bills These bills are then grouped by date and vendor, so we don\u2019t mix bills that have nothing in common. Then all possible combinations are generated for each group. For each combination, a \u00ab meta bill \u00bb is created from the grouped bills and this meta bill is passed in the matching algorithm to find a debit transaction that matches with it. If a transaction is found, then all the bills making the meta bill are linked to it using the same logic as before.","title":"Matching algorithm"},{"location":"cozy-banks/docs/bills-matching/#billstransactions-matching-algorithm","text":"The matching algorithm is in charge of finding matchings between io.cozy.bills and io.cozy.bank.operations documents.

If you don\u2019t, please check the official documentation and follow the instructions to install it on your system. Then you can install the dependencies: $ yarn Develop: $ yarn watch And build: $ yarn build Please note that for the project to work, you will need to have a working cozy-stack. See how to run a cozy application for more information. When watching, you still need to have a cozy-stack running to serve the files of the app (do not use the webpack-dev-server directly). This is important as the stack injects through template variables the token and domain used to connect to the cozy. \u26a0\ufe0f CSPs must be disabled when working with the development server (as the index.html is served via the stack but the JS assets are served via webpack-dev-server). You can do this via a browser extension ( Chrome ) or you can tell the stack to disable CSPs via its config file ( disable_csp: true , check here for more info on the config file). See an example config file here . Fixtures \u00b6 While developing, it is convenient to be able to inject and remove arbitraty data on your local instance. We have a set of fake banking data in the test/fixtures/demo.json file that you can inject in your instance using the yarn fixtures command. If you want to inject other data or remove some data, you can use ACH . Develop on mobile \u00b6 Get a working Android environment \u00b6 To be able to build the app for Android, you can follow this guide (in french for now, will be translated soon, don\u2019t hesitate to open a pull request). Build and run the mobile app \u00b6 To build the mobile app, you first have to run one of the following commands: # One-shot build $ yarn build:mobile # To develop $ yarn watch:mobile Then you can run the app on the desired platform. For Android: # Run on a real device $ yarn android:run # Run on an emulator $ yarn android:run:emulator For iOS: # Run on a real device $ yarn ios:run # Run on an emulator $ yarn ios:run:emulator Hot reload on mobile app \u00b6 # Replace the host with your own host (find it with ifconfig) $ env DEV_HOST = 192.168.1.36 yarn build:mobile:hot $ yarn ios:run # at this point the app is blank since it cannot access the files from your host $ env DEV_HOST = 192.168.1.36 yarn watch:mobile:hot # launch a webpack-dev-server \u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f If you watch a production build, you must edit the webpack config to have the filepath without the [hash] otherwise you will not hit the right JS file. \u26a0\ufe0f You need to have the final / at the end of the PUBLIC_PATH, otherwise some some CSS resources like fonts will not load Release \u00b6 A release consists in publishing the app on all platforms: web (via the Cozy Registry ), Android (via the Google Play Store, APKs are also linked to Github releases ) and iOS (via the App Store). Start a release branch \u00b6 When starting a release, start the checklist PR with : yarn release This will ask for the next version number and create a release branch with it. If you have Hub installed (recommended), it will also create the related pull request for you. Workflow \u00b6 When a release branch is created, features are frozen and the branch should only receive bugfixes. To create beta versions, you have to do two thinkgs: Bump the different version codes in src/targets/mobile/config.xml file (see below for more details android-versionCode , ios-CFBundleVersion , version and AppendUserAgent ) Commit it and create a tag with the X.Y.Z-beta.M scheme (for example 1.5.0-beta.1 ) and push them The web app beta version will be automatically built and published on the cozy registry. An APK for Android will also be automatically created. For iOS, you have to build the app and upload it on Testflight. Mobile apps version codes \u00b6 In the src/targets/mobile/config.xml file, you have to update multiple version codes: version : the generic version code ios-CFBundleVersion : the version code specific to iOS android-versionCode : the version code specific to Android AppendUserAgent : a version code that is appended to the user agent string so we can know which version is related to messages in error logs Each version code is not built in the same way: version is the same as version in the package.json ios-CFBundleVersion is the same as version , but with a fourth number representing the beta version number (for example 1.5.0.1 for 1.5.0-beta.1 ) For android-versionCode , follow the following formula: beta + patch*100 + minor * 10000 + major * 1000000 . For example, 1.5.1-beta.1 gives us 1050101 AppendUserAgent is the same as version Publish manually on the Cozy registry \u00b6 To publish manually on the Cozy registry, you need a token also stored in Cozy internal password store : export REGISTRY_TOKEN=`pass registry/spaces/banks/banks.token` After, you can use cozy-app-publish to push the app to the registry. More information : https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/registry-publish.md Publish to mobile stores \u00b6 Pre-requisites \u00b6 Install cordova globally (necessary for the fastlane cordova plugin) yarn global add cordova@<same version as in package.json> Generate icons yarn mobile:icon On iOS, if the given splashscreens are not to the resoution of the device, iOS falls back to compatibility mode and adds blacks bars to the top/bottom of the screen. This is particularly disgraceful on the iPhoneX which has an unusual screen shape. To fix this, we use a single splashscreen file and set XCode for it to use Cordova\u2019s launch screen functionality. CozyBanks > Resources > Images.xcassets > LaunchStoryBoard > App icons and Launch images > LaunchScreenFile \"CDVLaunchScreen\" Install Ruby, Bundler and project dependencies See Ruby installation page to get the installation method for your system. Install Bundler : gem install bundler Then install the project dependencies : cd <path_to_project_root>/src/targets/mobile bundler Manage iOS native libraries sudo gem install cocoapods pod setup yarn ios:install_pods # Install pods according to the Podfile.lock You must also have the keys/ folder available from the internal password store. Fastlane \u00b6 Fastlane is used to manage automatically the deployment process. Its configuration is localed in src/targets/mobile/fastlane/Fastfile . iOS \u00b6 Signing \u00b6 \u26a0\ufe0f You need to have your device registered to iTunes Connect. If you have trouble deploying your app on your device, check that the Build settings in XCode are correct : While developing, in XCode, in the \u201cSigning\u201d section : Check \u201cManage automatically\u201d Team \u201cCozy Cloud\u201d Signing certificate : use a personal certificate belonging to the Cozy team (can be created when you have no matching certificate in the menu > Add an account). When deploying, Fastlane manages the certificate and may change it. Push iOS build \u00b6 To push an iOS build on Testflight, use the following command : yarn run ios:publish To fully publish the app, go to iTunes Connect using the credentials in the password store and \u201csubmit for review\u201d. Android \u00b6 Two keys will be asked during publishing, they are available in the password store in Gangsters/cozy-banks/keys/android : 1: jks-pass.gpg 2: cozy-banks-key-pass.gpg You will also have to have apksigner in your PATH. It is located in the Android SDK folder. export PATH $PATH:$HOME/.android/sdk/tools export PATH $PATH:$HOME/.android/sdk/build-tools/26.0.2 When publishing a new version on the Play Store, you can use : yarn run android:publish This will upload create a new version in the store, in the beta track that you can review visually on the Play Store and then promote to the normal track. Notifications \u00b6 How to develop on templates \u00b6 With the TEST_TEMPLATES environment variable, an express server serving the HTML emails will be built. $ env TEST_TEMPLATES = true yarn watch:services $ node build/testTemplates.js Rendering emails at http://localhost:8081! You can open your browser to check the emails. The Preview feature in Mailchimp is also useful to check that everything is correctly rendered on the various email clients (just copy/paste the content of the page). Under the covers \u00b6 The templates are Handlebars templates using the mjml language. mjml greatly reduces the pains to develop an email template as it deals with a lot of quirks for you. It features ready-made components to make responsive email templates. Behind the scene, it uses React to implement custom components, and juice to inline the CSS into the HTML.

Developing Banks exposes the following services: categorization onOperationOrBillCreate Account stats Automatic groups Categorization \u00b6 This service role is to categorize transactions. It is bound to no event at all, so it\u2019s not automatically triggered and needs to be explicitly called by a konnector or another service. This service is called from konnectors so that transactions are categorized as soon as possible (no debounce involved). When this service is ran, it gets all io.cozy.bank.operations that has the toCategorize property with a true value. Then it slices it into chunks and categorizes the most chunks it can before the service is stopped by the stack. If there are some uncategorized transactions remaining, it restarts itself to finish the work. If all transactions have been categorized, it calls the onOperationOrBillCreate service to trigger all other features. See the categorization documentation for more details about the categorization implementation. onOperationOrBillCreate \u00b6 This service has many roles. It does: Bills matching Notifications (push & email) Apps suggestions It is bound to the io.cozy.bills creation only. The creation of io.cozy.bank.operations should be managed by calling the categorization service. See the next section for more precise informations about that. Account stats \u00b6 Computes statistics on bank accounts and save the results in io.cozy.bank.accounts.stats doctype. Automatic groups \u00b6 Whenever an io.cozy.bank.accounts is created, we check if it could belong in an automatic group based on its type (checkings, savings, credit cards). These io.cozy.bank.groups documents are created with the auto: true attributes. Budget alerts \u00b6 A user can configure alerts to be alerted whenever the sum of its expenses has gone past a maximum threshold per month. The notification is sent as part of the onOperationOrBillCreate service. It is configured from a io.cozy.bank.settings document and the last notification date and amount are saved. A debug service is built to be able to only run this particular part and not the whole onOperationOrBillCreate service. It is possible to run it from the Debug tab in the application (or via Bender). I am writing a banking konnector, what should I do? \u00b6 If you want to benefit from all the features of these services, the most straightforward is to add toCategorize: true to the io.cozy.bank.operations your konnector creates, save these documents and then call the categorization service. Here is an example: const { cozyClient , BaseKonnector } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) class MyKonnector extends BaseKonnector { async saveTransactions () { const transactions = await this . fetchTransactions () transactions . forEach ( t => ( t . toCategorize = true )) // save `transactions` await cozyClient . jobs . create ( 'service' , { name : 'categorization' , slug : 'banks' }) } } Finally, you will need a permission to create io.cozy.jobs document.

Then it slices it into chunks and categorizes the most chunks it can before the service is stopped by the stack.

Install Creating a client How to query with Cozy Client How to mutate the data What\u2019s cozy-client? \u00b6 cozy-client is the sdk to interact with the cozy stack from a Javascript application. It aims at hidding all low level details and providing a simple high level API. Main features : Authentification with your Cozy Requests to the couchdb data Transparent relations between couchdb documents Automatically takes care of updating metadata in couch documents Offline: any data can be stored in a local cache without impacting your code that can continue to read and write. In addition, the library also provides a React integration to connect your components to the data stored in the cozy stack (with automatic refresh when the data is updated) Additional features with plugins : Real-time : be notified when changes occur on the server side. InterApp : API to interact with other apps (exemple : file picking within your app) The following guide is an overview of a cozy-client integration to help you getting started. Install \u00b6 npm install --save cozy-client or yarn add cozy-client CozyClient is the master of your data: it manages data queries and their status. \u2139 If you use Jest, you should also add a bit of configuration for imports to works properly, see at the end of this document . Creating a client \u00b6 import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const schema = { todos : { doctype : 'io.cozy.todos' , attributes : {...}, relationships : {...} } } const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , schema , token : '...' }) If you need guidance to get the URI of your instance and/or the token, see the app tutorial . Every doctype accessed in cozy-client needs to be declared in the schema section of the options. See the specific documentation on how to use the schema features. How to query with Cozy Client \u00b6 The two main methods to query data with cozyClient are find() and get() . Both take an doctype as first argument and return a QueryDefinition object: client . find ( 'io.cozy.todos' ) client . get ( 'io.cozy.todos' , '5fcbbf2cb171b1d5c3bc6df3d4affb32' ) A QueryDefinition is a special object that describe a query to be sent to CouchDB. It uses a fluent interface: client . find ( 'io.cozy.todos' ) . select ([ 'title' , 'checked' ]) . where ({ checked : false }) . include ([ 'dependencies' ]) . sortBy ([{ 'cozyMetadata.updatedAt' : 'desc' }]) . limitBy ( 20 ) select() lists the fields you want in the response (all by default), where() allows a mango selector , include() allows to name the relationships in the schema that you want to load in your response, then sortBy and limitBy restricts the returned results. By default all fields in the where() are automatically indexed. You can reverse this behaviour by specifying explicitly the list of fields to be indexed in indexFields() . Finally, client.query() will execute your query and return a promise with a data attribute containing the requested documents. import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ /*...*/ }) client . query ( client . find ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ checked : false }) ). then ( ({ data }) => console . log ( data ) ) How to mutate the data \u00b6 An instance of CozyClient allows you to query and mutate (update) data, here\u2019s how it looks: import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ /*...*/ }) // create a new io.cozy.todo await client . create ( 'io.cozy.todos' , { label : 'Buy bread' , checked : false }) client . query ( client . find ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ checked : false }) ). then ( ({ data }) => { const doc = data [ 0 ] // modify existing io.cozy.todo await client . save ({... doc , checked : true }) } ) Both create() and save() will return a Promise with a data attribute containing the saved document.

It uses a fluent interface: client . find ( 'io.cozy.todos' ) . select ([ 'title' , 'checked' ]) . where ({ checked : false }) . include ([ 'dependencies' ]) . sortBy ([{ 'cozyMetadata.updatedAt' : 'desc' }]) . limitBy ( 20 ) select() lists the fields you want in the response (all by default), where() allows a mango selector , include() allows to name the relationships in the schema that you want to load in your response, then sortBy and limitBy restricts the returned results. By default all fields in the where() are automatically indexed. You can reverse this behaviour by specifying explicitly the list of fields to be indexed in indexFields() . Finally, client.query() will execute your query and return a promise with a data attribute containing the requested documents. import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ /*...*/ }) client . query ( client . find ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ checked : false }) ). then ( ({ data }) => console . log ( data ) )","title":"How to query with Cozy Client"},{"location":"cozy-client/getting-started/#how-to-mutate-the-data","text":"An instance of CozyClient allows you to query and mutate (update) data, here\u2019s how it looks: import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ /*...*/ }) // create a new io.cozy.todo await client . create ( 'io.cozy.todos' , { label : 'Buy bread' , checked : false }) client . query ( client . find ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ checked : false }) ). then ( ({ data }) => { const doc = data [ 0 ] // modify existing io.cozy.todo await client . save ({... doc , checked : true }) } ) Both create() and save() will return a Promise with a data attribute containing the saved document.","title":"How to mutate the data"},{"location":"cozy-client/getting-started/#connecting-with-you-react-components","text":"CozyClient comes with HOC and render props functions to connect to your data inside you own components.

Starting the OAuth flow \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u00b6 Before you can start making requests to the server, you will need to get a token. cozy-client will provide a URL to a page where the user is shown what data you want to access, and asking for his or her permission. After the user accepts these permissions, he or she is redirected to the oauth.redirectURI that you declared earlier. You will then have to give this redirected URL back to cozy-client as it contains a code, that will be exchanged for the token. To get started, you call client.startOAuthFlow like this: import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , scope : [ 'io.cozy.mydoctype' ], oauth : { clientName : 'MyClient' , softwareID : 'MyAppId' , redirectURI : 'http://localhost' } }) client . startOAuthFlow ( openURL ) The openURL parameter is a callback.

Once connected, your components will receive the requesting data and a fetch status in their props. The data will automatically be refreshed upon modification. 1. Setup 1.a Initialize a CozyClient provider 1.b Use your own Redux store 2. Usage 2.a Requesting data with `` 2.b Requesting data with the queryConnect HOC 2.c Using a fetch policy to decrease network requests 3. Mutating data 4. Testing 1. Setup \u00b6 The following procedure requires you to already know how to initialize a CozyClient instance and create a query to fetch documents. 1.a Initialize a CozyClient provider \u00b6 Import CozyClient and CozyProvider import CozyClient , { CozyProvider } from 'cozy-client' Initialize a CozyClient instance (see the CozyClient() documentation for additional parameters, for example to provide a schema) const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , token : '...' }) Then wrap you React application inside a CozyProvider component with your newly instance of CozyClient in its props as client . function MyCozyApp ( props ) { return < CozyProvider client = { client }> < MyApp { ...props } /> </ CozyProvider > } ReactDOM . render (< MyCozyApp />, document . getElementById ( 'main' ) ) The CozyClient will be available for consumption to all components inside your wrapped application. 1.b Use your own Redux store \u00b6 cozy-client uses redux internally to centralize the statuses of the various fetches and replications triggered by the library, and to store locally the data in a normalized way. If you already have a redux store in your app, you can configure cozy-client to use this existing store: import CozyClient , { CozyProvider } from 'cozy-client' import { combineReducers , createStore , applyMiddleware } from 'redux' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , token : '...' }) const store = createStore ( combineReducers ({ ... myReducers , cozy : client . reducer () }), applyMiddleware ( myMiddleware ) ) function MyCozyApp ( props ) { return < CozyProvider client = { client } store = { store }> < MyApp { ...props } /> </ CozyProvider > } ReactDOM . render (< MyCozyApp />, document . getElementById ( 'main' ) ) 2. Usage \u00b6 2.a Requesting data with <Query /> \u00b6 To make it easy to fetch data and make it available to your component, we provide a Render Props component called Query . Basic example of usage: import { Query , isQueryLoading } from 'cozy-client' const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const checked = { checked : false } const query = client => client . find ( todos ). where ( checked ) function TodoList ( props ) { return < Query query = { query }> { queryResult => isQueryLoading ( queryResult ) ? < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > : < ul >{ queryResult . data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } </ Query > } When we use Query to \u201cwrap\u201d a component, three things happen: - The query passed as a prop will be executed when Query mounts, resulting in the loading of data from the local Pouchdb (if any) or from the server; in the future it may load the data directly from the client-side store; - Query subscribes to the store, so that it is updated if the data changes; - Query passes the result of the query as props to the children function. The following props will be given to your wrapped component: - data : an array of documents - fetchStatus : the status of the fetch ( pending , loading , loaded or error ) - lastFetch : when the last fetch occured - hasMore : the fetches being paginated, this property indicates if there are more documents to load You can also pass a function intead of a direct query. Your function will be given the props of the component and should return the requested query: import { Query } from 'cozy-client' const query = function ( props ) { const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const where = { checked : props . checked } return client => client . find ( todos ). where ( where ) } function TodoList () { return < Query query = { query } checked = { props . checked }> { ({ data , fetchStatus }) => fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ? < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > : < ul >{ data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } </ Query > } // use <TodoList checked={false} /> Note: Your query will be bound when the <Query/> component mounts. Future changes in props will not modify the query. 2.b Requesting data with the queryConnect HOC \u00b6 At your preference, you can use an higher-order component. queryConnect will take the name of the props field where it should send the result of the query and the actual query: import { queryConnect } from 'cozy-client' function TodoList ( props ) { const { data , fetchStatus } = props . result if ( fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ) { return < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > } else { return < ul >{ data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } } const dest = 'result' const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const checked = { checked : false } const query = ( client , props ) => client . find ( 'id' , props . id ). where ( checked ) const queryOpts = { [ dest ] : { query } } const ConnectedTodoList = queryConnect ( queryOpts )( TodoList ) queryConnect will use <Query /> internally so you will inherits the same behaviour. With the same syntax, you may register multiple queries to run: import { queryConnect } from 'cozy-client' function TodoList ( props ) { const { data , fetchStatus } = props . checked if ( fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ) { return < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > } else { return < ul >{ data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } } const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const checked = { query : client => client . find ( todos ). where ({ checked : false }) } const archived = { query : client => client . find ( todos ). where ({ archive : false }) } const queries = { checked , archived } const ConnectedTodoList = queryConnect ( queries )( TodoList ) 2.c Using a fetch policy to decrease network requests \u00b6 When multiple components share the same data, you might want to share the data between the two components. In this case, you do not want to execute 2 network requests for the same data, the two components should share the same data and only 1 network request should be executed. There are two solutions: 1) Lift the data fetching up the React tree: make a parent of the two components be the responsible of the data. 2) Using fetch policies to prevent re-fetching of the data 1 can be a good solution but sometimes the components needing the data are too far down the tree and/or too decoupled; it might not make sense to lift the data fetching up only to have to drill the data down the tree again. Using both Query and queryConnect , you can declare a fetch policy . It tells cozy-client if it should execute the query at componentDidMount time. It enables n components to be connected to the same query without triggering n requests. A fetch policy is a function receiving the state of the current query and returning true if it should be fetched and false otherwise. It is important to name the query with as when using fetch policies otherwise query data cannot be shared across components. import { Q } from 'cozy-client' const query = () => Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ) // io.cozy.todos will not be refetched if there are already io.cozy.todos // in the store and the data is fresh (updated less than 30s ago). const fetchPolicy = CozyClient . olderThan ( 30 * 1000 ) const as = 'my-query' // With Query and a render prop < Query as = { as } query = { query } fetchPolicy = { fetchPolicy }>{ ({ data : todos }) => {< TodoList todos = { todos } />} }</ Query > // With queryConnect queryConnect ({ todos : { as , query , fetchPolicy } })( TodoList ) See CozyClient::fetchPolicies for the API documentation. 3. Mutating data \u00b6 The simplest way is to use the withClient high order component. It will inject a client in your props with the CozyClient instance you gave to the <CozyProvider /> upper. import { withClient } from 'cozy-client' function TodoList ( props ) { const { client } = props const createNewTodo = e => client . create ( 'io.cozy.todos' , { label : e . target . elements [ 'new-todo' ], checked : false } ) return ( < ul > { /* todo items */ } </ ul > < form onSubmit = { createNewTodo }> < label htmlFor = \"new-todo\" > Todo </ label > < input id = \"new-todo\" name = \"new-todo\" /> < button type = \"submit\" > Add todo </ button > </ form > ) } const ConnectedTodoList = withClient ( TodoList ) <Query /> also takes a mutations optional props. It should have a function that will receive the CozyClient instance, the query requested and the rest of props given to the component, and should return a keyed object which will be added to the props of your wrapped component. import { Query } from 'cozy-client' const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const checked = { checked : false } const query = client => client . find ( todos ). where ( checked ) const mutations = client => ({ createDocument : client . create . bind ( client ) }) function TodoList () { return < Query query = { query } mutations = { mutations }> { ({ data , fetchStatus }) => fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ? < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > : < ul >{ data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } </ Query > } 4. Testing \u00b6 When testing, it is useful to prefill the client with data and mock the network. You can use createMockClient for this. Say we want to test the following component: import React from 'react' import { queryConnect , Q } from 'cozy-client' function DumbTodoList ( props ) { const { data , fetchStatus } = props . todos if ( fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ) { return < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > } else { return ( < ul > { data . map ( todo => ( < li key = { todo . id }>{ todo . label }</ li > ))} </ ul > ) } } const TodoList = queryConnect ({ todos : { as : 'todos' , query : () => Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ) } })( DumbTodoList ) export default TodoList We want to make sure the component renders correctly. In our test, we can create a mocked client with predefined data for the todos query, and snapshot it: import React from 'react' import { createMockClient , CozyProvider , } from 'cozy-client' import { mount } from 'enzyme' import TodoList from './TodoList' describe ( 'TodoList' , () => { it ( 'should show the todos' , () => { const client = createMockClient ({ queries : { todos : { doctype : 'io.cozy.todos' , data : [ { id : 'todo1' , name : 'Write tests' , done : true }, { id : 'todo2' , name : 'Write code' , done : true }, { id : 'todo3' , name : 'Take breaks' , done : true }, { id : 'todo4' , name : 'Write documentation' , done : false } ] } } }) const wrapper = mount ( < CozyProvider client = { client }> < TodoList /> </ CozyProvider > ) expect ( wrapper . html ()). toMatchSnapshot () }) })","title":"React integration"},{"location":"cozy-client/react-integration/#what-is-the-cozy-client-react-integration","text":"In addition to the Javascript client, Cozy-Client provides a way to connect directly the data from your Cozy instance to your React components.

Providing schemas \u00b6 Schemas are provided with a keyed object in the schema parameter at CozyClient initialization: const schema = { todos : { doctype : 'io.cozy.books' , attributes : {}, relationships : { items : { doctype : 'io.cozy.contact' , type : 'has-many' } } } } const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , token : '...' , schema }) Adding a schema to an already initialized CozyClient instance \u00b6 Provide your schemas to the addSchema() method, in the same form as for initialization: const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , token : '...' , schema : { } }) const additionalSchema = { todos : { doctype : 'io.cozy.books' , attributes : {}, relationships : { items : { doctype : 'io.cozy.contact' , type : 'has-many' } } } } client . addSchema ( additionalSchema ) Validation \u00b6 Today Cozy-Client only validates uniqueness of fields described as is in the schema. If you provide a schema, Cozy-Client will automatically try to validate your documents when you save them. An exception will be thrown if the validation fails. You can validate a document explicitly with validate() .

Q Helper to create a QueryDefinition. Recommended way to create query definitions. isQueryLoading Returns whether the result of a query (given via queryConnect or Query) is loading. hasQueryBeenLoaded Returns whether a query has been loaded at least once Functions \u00b6 createClientInteractive() Creates a client with interactive authentication.

They are also responsible for building the QueryDefinition that is used by the client to automatically fetch relationship data. Hydrated documents used by components come with Association instances. Kind : global class Association new Association(target, name, doctype, options) instance .target : object .name : string .doctype : string .get : function .save : function .dispatch : function .raw .data .query(queryDefinition) .mutate() static .query() \u21d2 QueryDefinition new Association(target, name, doctype, options) \u00b6 Example: The schema defines an author relationship : const BOOK_SCHEMA = { relationships : { author : 'has-one' } } Hydrated books will have the author association instance under the author key. Accessing hydratedBook.author.data gives you the author from the store, for example : { \"name\" : \"St-Exupery\" , \"firstName\" : \"Antoine\" , \"_id\" : \"antoine\" } It is the responsibility of the relationship to decide how the relationship data is stored. For example, here since we use the default has-one relationship, the relationship data is stored in the relationships attribute of the original document (in our case here, our book would be { \"title\" : \"Le petit prince\" , \"relationships\" : { \"author\" : { \"data\" : { \"doctype\" : \"io.cozy.authors\" , \"_id\" : \"antoine\" } } } } In the case of an \u201cin-place\u201d relationship, the relationship data is stored directly under the attribute named by the relationship (in our case author ). Our book would be { \"title\" : \"Le petit prince\" , \"author\" : \"antoine\" } Each different type of Association may change: get raw : how the relationship data is stored (either as per the JSON API spec or in a custom way) get data : how the store documents are then fetched from the store to be added to the hydrated document (.data method). View components will access hydratedDoc[relationshipName].data . get query : how to build the query to fetch related documents Param Type Description target object Original object containing raw data name string Attribute under which the association is stored doctype string Doctype of the documents managed by the association options string options.dispatch function Store\u2019s dispatch, comes from the client association.target : object \u00b6 The original document declaring the relationship Kind : instance property of Association association.name : string \u00b6 The name of the relationship.

You need to call save() in order to synchronize your document with the store. Kind : instance method of HasMany Todo [ ] We shouldn\u2019t create the array of relationship manually since it\u2019ll not be present in the store as well. We certainly should use something like updateRelationship HasManyInPlace \u00b6 Used when related documents are stored directly under the attribute with only the ids. Kind : global class new HasManyInPlace() \u00b6 An example document representing a TODO. See as the related tasks are represented via ids. const todo = { label : \"Protect people's privacy\" , tasks : [ 1 , 2 ] } Here is the Schema that would represent this kind of document. Components receiving todos via Query s would have an instance of HasManyInPlace as their tasks attribute. const schema = { todos : { doctype : 'io.cozy.todos' , relationships : { tasks : { doctype : 'io.cozy.tasks' , type : 'has-many-in-place' } } } } const todo = { label : \"Get rich\" , tasks : [ 1 , 2 ] } HasManyTriggers \u21d0 HasMany \u00b6 Association used for konnectors to retrieve all their related triggers.

The main mean of interaction with the client should be with events like \u201clogin\u201d/\u201dlogout\u201d. The plugin system is meant to encourage separation of concerns, modularity and testability : instead of registering events at module level, please create a plugin that subscribes to events. Plugin instances are stored internally in the plugins attribute of the client and can be accessed via this mean. A plugin class must have the attribute pluginName that will be use as the key in the plugins object. Two plugins with the same pluginName cannot co-exist. Kind : instance method of CozyClient Example class AlertPlugin { constructor ( client , options ) { this . client = client this . options = options this . handleLogin = this . handleLogin . bind ( this ) this . handleLogout = this . handleLogout . bind ( this ) this . client . on ( \"login\" , this . handleLogin ) this . client . on ( \"logout\" , this . handleLogout ) } handleLogin() { alert ( this . options . onLoginAlert ) } handleLogout() { alert ( this . options . onLogoutAlert ) } } AlertPlugin . pluginName = 'alerts' client . registerPlugin ( AlertPlugin , { onLoginAlert : 'client has logged in !' , onLogoutAlert : 'client has logged out !' }) // the instance of the plugin is accessible via client . plugins . alerts cozyClient.login(options) \u21d2 Promise \u00b6 Notify the links that they can start and set isLogged to true.

Kind : instance method of CozyClient Returns : object - Contains the fetched token and the client information. cozyClient.setStore(store) \u00b6 Sets the internal store of the client. Use this when you want to have cozy-client\u2019s internal store colocated with your existing Redux store. Typically, you would need to do this only once in your application, this is why setStore throws if you do it twice. If you really need to set the store again, use options.force = true.

It returns a modified Promise for the intent document, having a custom start(element) method. This method interacts with the DOM to append an iframe to the given HTML element. This iframe will provide an access to an app, which will serve a service page able to manage the intent action for the intent doctype. The start(element) method returns a promise for the result document provided by intent service. On Intent ready callback: This start method also takes a second optional argument which is a callback function ( start(element, onReadyCallback) ). When provided, this function will be run when the intent iframe will be completely loaded (using the onload iframe listener). This callback could be useful to run a client code only when the intent iframe is ready and loaded. An intent has to be created everytime an app need to perform an action over a doctype for wich it does not have permission. For example, the Cozy Drive app should create an intent to pick a io.cozy.contacts document. The cozy-stack will determines which app can offer a service to resolve the intent. It\u2019s this service\u2019s URL that will be passed to the iframe src property. Once the intent process is terminated by service, the iframe is removed from DOM. Example \u00b6 cozy . client . intents . create ( 'EDIT' , 'io.cozy.photos' , { action : 'crop' , width : 100 , height : 100 }) . start ( document . getElementById ( 'intent-service-wrapper' )) See cozy-stack documentation for more details. You can also use .then to run some code after the intents is terminated like following: cozy . client . intents . create ( 'EDIT' , 'io.cozy.photos' , { action : 'crop' , width : 100 , height : 100 }) . start ( document . getElementById ( 'intent-service-wrapper' )) . then ( doc => { // after service.terminate(doc) // code to use the doc }) Example to use removeIntentFrame() method (by passing the flag exposeIntentFrameRemoval flag): cozy . client . intents . create ( 'EDIT' , 'io.cozy.photos' , { action : 'crop' , width : 100 , height : 100 , exposeIntentFrameRemoval : true }) . start ( document . getElementById ( 'intent-service-wrapper' )) . then ({ removeIntentFrame , doc } => { // after service.terminate(doc) // Code to be run before removing the terminated intent iframe removeIntentFrame () // Other code, use doc }) cozy.client.intents.createService() \u00b6 cozy.client.intents.createService([intentId, window]) has to be used in the intent service page. It initializes communication with the parent window (remember: the service is supposed to be in an iframe). If intentId and window parameters are not provided the method will try to retrieve them automatically. It returns a service object, which provides the following methods : * compose(action, doctype, data) : request the client to make a second intent. This returns a promise fulfilled with the second intent result. js // ... const app = await service.compose('INSTALL', 'io.cozy.apps', { slug: 'drive' }) * getData() : returns the data passed to the service by the client. * getIntent() : returns the intent * resizeClient(doc, transitionProperty) : forces the size of the intent modale to a given width, maxWidth, height, maxHeight, or dimensions of a given element. The second optional argument transitionProperty can be used to add a CSS transition property on the intent in order to \u2018animate\u2019 the resizing. js // resize the client ot 300 pixels max height service.resizeClient({ maxHeight: 300 }, '.2s linear') // will be in css -> transition: .2s linear; // or service.resizeClient({ element: document.querySelector('.class') }) On intent size: If an intent is used by multiple applications, we don\u2019t use resizeClient(), since each application can have his own layout. You have to define the size of the intent in your application terminate(doc) : ends the intent process by passing to the client the resulting document doc . An intent service may only be terminated once. If a boolean exposeIntentFrameRemoval is found as true in the data sent by the client, the terminate() method will return an object with as properties a function named removeIntentFrame to remove the iframe DOM node (in order to be run by the client later on) and the resulting document doc . This could be useful to animate an intent closing and remove the iframe node at the animation ending. cancel() : ends the intent process by passing a null value to the client. This method terminate the intent service the same way that terminate() . throw(error) : throw an error to client and causes the intent promise rejection. Example \u00b6 cozy . client . intents . createService ( '77bcc42c-0fd8-11e7-ac95-8f605f6e8338' , window ) . then ( intentService => { const data = intentService . getData () // [...] // Do stuff with data // [...] const resultingDoc = { type : 'io.cozy.photos' , width : 100 , height : 100 } intentService . terminate ( resultingDoc ) }) cozy.client.intents.getRedirectionURL() \u00b6 cozy.client.intents.getRedirectionURL(doctype, data) retrieves a redirection URL for a given doctype, with specified data.

This URL can be used as link href for example, to show the doctype or the document in an application able to handle it. Example \u00b6 const myFolder = { folder : '4bce4649-e7b7-4226-d82e-6b87dbb684e7' } const url = await cozy . client . getRedirectionURL ( 'io.cozy.files' , myFolder ) // url is http://domain-app.cozy.rocks/#/files?folder=4bce4649-e7b7-4226-d82e-6b87dbb684e7 cozy.client.intents.redirect() \u00b6 cozy.client.intents.redirect(doctype, data) is based on cozy.client.intents.getRedirectionURL() and it redirects the browser to the retrieved URL.","title":"Intents"},{"location":"cozy-client-js/intents-api/#intents","text":"","title":"Intents"},{"location":"cozy-client-js/intents-api/#cozyclientintentscreate","text":"cozy.client.intents.create(action, doctype [, data, permissions]) create an intent.

Any doctype you introduce is expected to be prefixed with the reverse notation of a domain you own (JLS#7.7). If you do not own a domain, you can also use a reverse notation of your email address. You are free to reuse another applications documents by using their doctypes but you SHOULD discuss with the domain owner if you want to add fields or format them differently. To ensure retrocompatibility, when used on stack v2, all known doctypes will be auto-prefixed, but a warning will be written to the console. Unknown doctype will cause a fatal error.

Registration parameters \u00b6 In order to handle the registration of the client, two callbacks should be provided to the cozy-client-js instance. clientParams an object with the following parameters: redirectURI : the URI on which the user is redirected after accepting the client (mandatory) softwareID : identifier of the software (by default github.com/cozy/cozy-client-js ) softwareVersion : version of the software (optional) clientName : string (optional) clientKind : string (optional) clientURI : string (optional) logoURI : string (optional) policyURI : string (optional) scopes : array of key:value elements representing the permission scopes required by the application that the user should accept (mandatory) onRegistered(client, url) which should provide the wanted \u201cside effect\u201d after the client registration and return a promise containing the request URL provided by the user containing the access code and state.

It could also contain an attribute token for OAuth konnectors. data : {object} Additional custom data. label : {string} Label given by user. state : {string} The account state is used to communicate between the konnector and Harvest to ask for a needed 2FA Code or to tell to reset the konnector session for example. Here are the used values for now: TWOFA_NEEDED : The service is asking for a Two Factor connexion and the related code (sent by the service) must be provided by the user. This status can be further precised with its type. This allows the UI presented to the user to have custom messages, depending on the type of two factor authentication required by the vendor. TWOFA_NEEDED.EMAIL : If the two factor authentication is done by email TWOFA_NEEDED.SMS : If the two factor authentication is done by SMS TWOFA_NEEDED_RETRY : The 2FA code provided by the user is wrong, the user can retry by providing a new one. TWO_FA_NEEDED_RETRY.EMAIL and TWO_FA_NEEDED_RETRY.SMS can also be used.

As auth should only be used for authentication mechanisms, those two values should disappear soon. folderPath should purely and simply disappear, the folder information is stored in io.cozy.trigger . accountName is in reality the label , change should be made soon to fix this mistake. frequency should move at the root of the account. namePath : The name of the last folder. Usually saved along with folderPath . The auth attributes also contain all values for the fields attribute specified in the manifest.konnector file. Relationships \u00b6 parent \u00b6 An account may have a parent relationship. It is used to indicate that this accounts depends on another one. Generally, the konnector should be able to handle by itself this kind of relationshiop, like querying the database to get the information it needs. A parent relationship is aimed to be an account overriden by the account it is linked to, but it can also be use as an aggregator account. See Cozy-stack documentation about aggregator accounts . Example \u00b6 { \"relationships\" : { \"parent\" : { \"data\" : { \"_id\" : \"aggregator-service-account\" , \"_type\" : \"io.cozy.accounts\" } } } } Vault Cipher \u00b6 An account can be synced in a password manager.

Will create io.cozy.bills objects. The default deduplication keys are ['date', 'amount', 'vendor'] . You need the full permission on io.cozy.bills , full permission on io.cozy.files and also full permission on io.cozy.bank.operations in your manifest, to be able to use this function. Parameters: documents is an array of objects with any attributes with some mandatory attributes : amount (Number): the amount of the bill used to match bank operations date (Date): the date of the bill also used to match bank operations vendor (String): the name of the vendor associated to the bill. Ex: \u2018trainline\u2019 currency (String) default: EUR: The ISO currency value (not mandatory since there is a default value. contractId (String): Contract unique identicator used to deduplicate bills contractLabel : (String) User label if define, must be used with contractId matchingCriterias (Object): criterias that can be used by an external service to match bills with bank operations. If not specified but the \u2018banksTransactionRegExp\u2019 attribute is specified in the manifest of the connector, this value is automatically added to the bill You can also pass attributes expected by saveFiles : fileurl, filename, requestOptions and more Please take a look at io.cozy.bills doctype documentation - fields (object) this is the first parameter given to BaseKonnector\u2019s constructor - options is passed directly to saveFiles , hydrateAndFilter , addData and linkBankOperations . Kind : Exported function Example const { BaseKonnector , saveBills } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch ( fields ) { const documents = [] // some code which fills documents return saveBills ( documents , fields , { identifiers : [ 'vendor' ] }) }) saveFiles \u00b6 Saves the given files in the given folder via the Cozy API. saveFiles(entries, fields, options) \u23cf \u00b6 Saves the files given in the fileurl attribute of each entries You need the full permission on io.cozy.files in your manifest to use this function. Kind : Exported function Param Type Description entries Array list of object describing files to save entries.fileurl string The url of the file (can be a function returning the value). Ignored if filestream is given entries.fetchFile function the connector can give it\u2019s own function to fetch the file from the website, which will be run only when necessary (if the corresponding file is missing on the cozy) function returning the stream). This function must return a promise resolved as a stream entries.filestream object the stream which will be directly passed to cozyClient.files.create (can also be function returning the stream) entries.requestOptions object The options passed to request to fetch fileurl (can be a function returning the value) entries.filename string The file name of the item written on disk. This attribute is optional and as default value, the file name will be \u201csmartly\u201d guessed by the function. Use this attribute if the guess is not smart enough for you, or if you use filestream (can be a function returning the value). entries.shouldReplaceName string used to migrate filename. If saveFiles finds a file linked to this entry and this file name matches shouldReplaceName , the file is renamed to filename (can be a function returning the value) entries.shouldReplaceFile function use this function to state if the current entry should be forced to be redownloaded and replaced. Usefull if we know the file content can change and we always want the last version. entries.fileAttributes object ex: {created_at: new Date()} sets some additionnal file attributes passed to cozyClient.file.create entries.subPath string A subpath to save all files, will be created if needed. fields object is the argument given to the main function of your connector by the BaseKonnector. It especially contains a folderPath which is the string path configured by the user in collect/home options object global options options.timeout number timestamp which can be used if your connector needs to fetch a lot of files and if the stack does not give enough time to your connector to fetch it all. It could happen that the connector is stopped right in the middle of the download of the file and the file will be broken. With the timeout option, the saveFiles function will check if the timeout has passed right after downloading each file and then will be sure to be stopped cleanly if the timeout is not too long. And since it is really fast to check that a file has already been downloaded, on the next run of the connector, it will be able to download some more files, and so on. If you want the timeout to be in 10s, do Date.now() + 10*1000 . You can try it in the previous code. options.contentType number | boolean ex: \u2018application/pdf\u2019 used to force the contentType of documents when they are badly recognized by cozy. If \u201ctrue\u201d the content type will be recognized from the file name and forced the same way. options.concurrency number default: 1 sets the maximum number of concurrent downloads options.validateFile function default: do not validate if file is empty or has bad mime type options.validateFileContent boolean | function default false. Also check the content of the file to recognize the mime type options.fileIdAttributes Array array of strings : Describes which attributes of files will be taken as primary key for files to check if they already exist, even if they are moved. If not given, the file path will used for deduplication as before. options.subPath string A subpath to save this file, will be created if needed. options.fetchFile function the connector can give it\u2019s own function to fetch the file from the website, which will be run only when necessary (if the corresponding file is missing on the cozy) function returning the stream). This function must return a promise resolved as a stream Example await saveFiles ([{ fileurl : 'https://...' , filename : 'bill1.pdf' }], fields , { fileIdAttributes : [ 'fileurl' ] }) saveIdentity \u00b6 Helper to set or merge io.cozy.identities See https://github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes/blob/master/docs/io.cozy.identities.md saveIdentity() \u23cf \u00b6 Set or merge a io.cozy.identities You need full permission for the doctype io.cozy.identities in your manifest, to be able to use this function. Parameters: contact (object): the identity to create/update as an object io.cozy.contacts accountIdentifier (string): a string that represent the account use, if available fields.login options (object): options which will be given to updateOrCreate directly : sourceAccount (String): id of the source account sourceAccountIdentifier (String): identifier unique to the account targetted by the connector. It is the login most of the time const { saveIdentity } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) const identity = { name : 'toto' , email : { 'address' : 'toto@example.com' } } return saveIdentity ( identity , fields . login ) Kind : Exported function signin \u00b6 Provides an handy method to log the user in, on HTML form pages. On success, it resolves to a promise with a parsed body. signin() \u23cf \u00b6 Provides an handy method to log the user in, on HTML form pages. On success, it resolves to a promise with a parsed body. Errors: LOGIN_FAILED if the validate predicate is false INVALID_FORM if the element matched by formSelector is not a form or has no action attribute UNKNOWN_PARSING_STRATEGY if parse is not one of the accepted values: raw , cheerio , json . VENDOR_DOWN if a request throws a RequestError, or StatusCodeError It does not submit values provided through select tags, except if populated by user with formData . url is the url to access the html form formSelector is used by cheerio to uniquely identify the form in which to log in formData is an object { name: value, \u2026 } . It is used to populate the form, in the proper inputs with the same name as the properties of this object, before submitting it. It can also be a function that returns this object. The page at url would be given as argument, right after having been parsed through cheerio . parse allow the user to resolve signin with a preparsed body. The choice of the strategy for the parsing is one of : raw , json or cheerio . cheerio being the default. validate is a predicate taking three arguments statusCode , parsedBody and fullResponse . If it is false, LOGIN_FAILED is thrown, otherwise the signin resolves with parsedBody value. requestOpts allows to pass eventual options to the signin \u2018s requestFactory . It could be useful for pages using latin1 encoding for instance. Kind : Exported function Example == basic example : == const $ = signin ({ url : `http://quotes.toscrape.com/login` , formSelector : 'form' , formData : { username , password } }) If the behavior of the targeted website is not standard. You can pass a validate function which will allow you to: - detect if the credentials work or not -> LOGIN_FAILED - detect if actions from the user are needed -> USER_ACTION_NEEDED - detect if the targeted website is out -> VENDOR_DOWN Example const $ = signin ({ url : `http://quotes.toscrape.com/login` , formSelector : 'form' , formData : { username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) { if ( statusCode !== 200 ) return false // LOGIN_FAILED if ( $ ( '.cgu' ). length ) throw new Error ( 'USER_ACTION_NEEDED' ) if ( fullResponse . request . uri . href . includes ( 'error' )) throw new Error ( 'VENDOR_DOWN' ) } }) Do not forget that the use of the signin function is not mandatory in a connector and won\u2019t work if the signin page does not use html forms. Here, a simple POST request may be a lot more simple. solveCaptcha \u00b6 Use every possible means to solve a captcha. At the moment, Anticaptcha web service is used if any related secret key is found in COZY_PARAMETERS environment variable. solveCaptcha() \u23cf \u00b6 Use every possible means to solve a captcha. At the moment, Anticaptcha web service is used if any related secret key is found in COZY_PARAMETERS environment variable. If you do not want to solve the captcha each time the connector is run, please also use CookieKonnector which will help you save the session. Parameters: params is an array of objects with any attributes with some mandatory attributes : type (String): (default recaptcha) type of captcha to solve. can be \u201crecaptcha\u201d or \u201cimage\u201d at the moment timeout (Number): (default 3 minutes after now) time when the solver should stop trying to solve the captcha websiteKey (String): the key you can find on the targeted website (for recaptcha) websiteURL (String): The URL of the page showing the captcha (for recaptcha) body (String): The base64 encoded image (for image captcha) Returns: Promise with the solved captcha response as a string Kind : Exported function Example const { solveCaptcha } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) const solvedKey = await solveCaptcha ({ websiteKey : 'the key in the webpage' , websiteURL : 'http://quotes.toscrape.com/login' , }) // now use the solveKey to submit your form updateOrCreate \u00b6 Creates or updates the given entries according to if they already exist in the cozy or not updateOrCreate() \u23cf \u00b6 Creates or updates the given entries according to if they already exist in the cozy or not You need the full permission for the given doctype in your manifest, to be able to use this function. entries (object array): Documents to save doctype (string): Doctype of the documents matchingAttributes (string array): attributes in each entry used to check if an entry already exists in the Cozy options (object): general option affecting metadata : sourceAccount (String): id of the source account sourceAccountIdentifier (String): identifier unique to the account targetted by the connector.

It is the fastest to get all documents but without filtering possibilities deprecated by the findAll method from cozyClient Parameters: doctype (string): the doctype from which you want to fetch the data Kind : inner method of utils utils~queryAll() \u00b6 This function allows to fetch all documents for a given doctype exceeding the 100 limit. It is slower that fetchAll because it fetches the data 100 by 100 but allows to filter the data with a selector and an index Parameters: doctype (string): the doctype from which you want to fetch the data selector (object): the mango query selector index (object): (optional) the query selector index. If not defined, the function will create it\u2019s own index with the keys specified in the selector const documents = await queryAll ( 'io.cozy.bills' , { vendor : 'Direct Energie' }) Kind : inner method of utils utils~findDuplicates() \u00b6 This function find duplicates in a given doctype, filtered by an optional mango selector Parameters: doctype (string): the doctype from which you want to fetch the data selector (object): (optional) the mango query selector options : keys (array) : List of keys used to check that two items are the same. index (optionnal) : Return value returned by cozy.data.defineIndex , the default will correspond to all documents of the selected doctype. selector (optionnal object) : Mango request to get records. Gets all the records by default Returns an object with the following keys: * toKeep : this is the list of unique documents that you should keep in db * toRemove : this is the list of documents that can remove from db. If this is io.cozy.bills documents, do not forget to clean linked bank operations const { toKeep , toRemove } = await findDuplicates ( 'io.cozy.bills' , { selector : { vendor : 'Direct Energie' }}) Kind : inner method of utils utils~batchUpdateAttributes() \u00b6 This is a shortcut to update multiple documents in one call Parameters: doctype (string): the doctype from which you want to fetch the data ids (array): array of ids of documents to update transformation (object): attributes to change with their values options : keys (array) : List of keys used to check that two items are the same. index (optionnal) : Return value returned by cozy.data.defineIndex , the default will correspond to all documents of the selected doctype. selector (optionnal object) : Mango request to get records.

It is not available for self-hosted instances. It will just do nothing in that case. The local model is based on the user manual categorizations. Each model adds two properties to the transactions: * The global model adds cozyCategoryId and cozyCategoryProba * The local model adds localCategoryId and localCategoryProba In the end, each transaction can have up to four different categories. An application can use these categories to show the most significant for the user. See https://github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes/blob/master/docs/io.cozy.bank.md#categories for more informations. Kind : inner method of categorization Returns : object - an object with a categorize method Example const { BaseKonnector , createCategorizer } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) class BankingKonnector extends BaseKonnector { async saveTransactions () { const transactions = await this . fetchTransactions () const categorizer = await createCategorizer const categorizedTransactions = await categorizer . categorize ( transactions ) // Save categorizedTransactions } } categorization~categorize() \u21d2 Array.<object> \u00b6 Initialize global and local models and categorize the given array of transactions Kind : inner method of categorization Returns : Array.<object> - the categorized transactions See : createCategorizer for more informations about models initialization Example const { BaseKonnector , categorize } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) class BankingKonnector extends BaseKonnector { async saveTransactions () { const transactions = await this . fetchTransactions () const categorizedTransactions = await categorize ( transactions ) // Save categorizedTransactions } } BaseKonnector \u00b6 The class from which all the connectors must inherit. It takes a fetch function in parameter that must return a Promise . You need at least the GET permission on io.cozy.accounts in your manifest to allow it to fetch account information for your connector. Its role is twofold : Make the link between account data and konnector Handle errors \u26a0\ufe0f A promise should be returned from the fetch function otherwise the konnector cannot know that asynchronous code has been called.

This function will be binded to the current connector. If not fetch function is given. The connector will have to handle itself it\u2019s own exection and error handling Example const { BaseKonnector } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch () { // use this to access the instance of the konnector to // store any information that needs to be passed to // different stages of the konnector return request ( 'http://ameli.fr' ) . then ( computeReimbursements ) . then ( saveBills ) }) baseKonnector.run() \u00b6 Entrypoint of the konnector Initializes connector attributes Awaits this.main Ensures errors are handled via this.fail Calls this.end when the main function succeeded Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.main() \u21d2 Promise \u00b6 Main runs after konnector has been initialized. Errors thrown will be automatically handled. Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : Promise - - The konnector is considered successful when it resolves baseKonnector.end() \u00b6 Hook called when the connector has ended successfully Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.fail() \u00b6 Hook called when the connector fails Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.initAttributes() \u00b6 Initializes konnector attributes that will be used during its lifetime this._account this.fields Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.saveAccountData(data, options) \u21d2 Promise \u00b6 Saves data to the account that is passed to the konnector. Use it to persist data that needs to be passed to each konnector run. By default, the data is merged to the remote data, use options.merge = false to overwrite the data. The data is saved under the .data attribute of the cozy account. Don\u2019t forget to modify the manifest.konnector file to give the right to write on the io.cozy.accounts doctype. The syntax can be : \"permissions\": {\"accounts\": {\"type\": \"io.cozy.accounts\"}} (here we juste removed the verb GET ) Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : Promise - : resolved with the modified account Param Type Description data object Attributes to be merged options object { merge: true baseKonnector.getAccountData() \u21d2 object \u00b6 Get the data saved by saveAccountData Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : object - the account data baseKonnector.updateAccountAttributes() \u00b6 Update account attributes and cache the account Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.setTwoFAState(options) \u00b6 Sets the 2FA state, according to the type passed. Doing so resets the twoFACode field Typically you should not use that directly, prefer to use waitForTwoFaCode since the wait for user input will be handled for you. It is useful though for the \u201capp\u201d type where no user input (inside Cozy) is needed. Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Param Type Description options object The list of options options.type string Used by the front to show the right message (email/sms/app) options.retry boolean Is this function call a retry ? This changes the resulting message to the user baseKonnector.resetTwoFAState() \u00b6 Resets 2FA state when not needed anymore Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.waitForTwoFaCode(options) \u21d2 Promise \u00b6 Notices that 2FA code is needed and wait for the user to submit it. It uses the account to do the communication with the user. Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : Promise - Contains twoFa code entered by user Throws : Will throw USER_ACTION_NEEDED.TWOFA_EXPIRED if the konnector job is not run manually (we assume that not run manually means that we do not have a graphic interface to fill the required information) Will throw USER_ACTION_NEEDED.TWOFA_EXPIRED if 2FA is not filled by the user soon enough Param Type Description options object The list of options options.type string (default: \u201cemail\u201d) - Type of the expected 2FA code. The message displayed to the user will depend on it. Possible values: email, sms options.timeout number (default 3 minutes after now) - After this date, the stop will stop waiting and and an error will be shown to the user (deprecated and alias of endTime) options.endTime number (default 3 minutes after now) - After this timestamp, the home will stop waiting and and an error will be shown to the user options.heartBeat number (default: 5000) - How many milliseconds between each code check options.retry boolean (default: false) - Is it a retry. If true, an error message will be displayed to the user Example const { BaseKonnector } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( start ) async function start () { // we detect the need of a 2FA code const code = this . waitForTwoFaCode ({ type : 'email' }) // send the code to the targeted site } baseKonnector.notifySuccessfulLogin() \u00b6 Tells Cozy-Home that we have successfully logged in. Useful when auto-success has been deactivated. See deactivateAutoSuccess Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.deactivateAutoSuccessfulLogin() \u00b6 By default, cozy-home considers that the konnector has successfully logged in when the konnector has run for more than 8s. This is problematic for 2FA since the konnector can sit idle, just waiting for the 2FA to come back. When this method is called, cozy-home is notified and will not consider the absence of error after 8s to be a success. Afterwards, to notify cozy-home when the user has logged in successfully, for example, after the user has entered 2FA codes, it is necessary to call notifySuccessfulLogin . Does nothing if called more than once.

Current usage \u00b6 When saving bills, cozy-konnector-libs provides a filtering and hydratation mechanism, to avoid overriding existing bills. It is done in function hydrateAndFilters . This method performs two actions : * hydrate entries retrieved from service with usable data from couchDB (like existing bill id) * filter entries retrieved from service and return only entries that need to be saved/synchronized. Objectives of this document \u00b6 The goals of this document are: Define a common way to store synchronization data for all konnector Propose a naive implementation for an abstract synchronisation data storing mechanism, provided by cozy-konnector-libs Propose a solution to synchronize every type of data or file, not only bills Taking the hydrateAndFilter function as basis, split it in three functions performing the following tasks : actual filtering, synchronization data hydratation and saving/updating current database document with correspondig external entries (the part done by the actual hydratation ) Storing synchronization data in documents \u00b6 Before saving any data or file, we will add in the relying document every synchronization data we will need. The added data will depend on how the service the konnector connects to retrieve entries and which information they gave us. Simple case, by id \u00b6 We suppose that in the most cases, we will face to entries provinding their own id attribute. The idea is to store it as synchronization data to be able to easily retrieve them later. To store synchronization data, we are using a sync attribute in document metadata attribute. Example: { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"id\" : \"7ee401e841c94159addb47f190903139\" , \"konnector\" : \"trainline\" , \"last_sync\" : \"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 16:25:34 GMT\" } } } The expected information to be save is: field role id The id of the document, but given by the external service. If the external service does not provide any id or uuid, it could be interesting to generate one, with an hash of the file for example. konnector The slug of the konnector (Example: trainline , freemobile , cic ). This could be very useful to retrieve data synchronized with this konnector. last_sync Date of last synchronization, set to now() when storage is made. By multiple attributes \u00b6 If the external service does not provide any id attribute, we may need to use instead a list of attributes, for example firstname , lastname , dateofbirth . { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"firstname\" : \"Claude\" , \"lastname\" : \"Causi\" , \"dateofbirth\" : \"06/12/1980\" } } } As we cannot be sure that we will have different data, it could be better to use a custom way of providing an unique identifier. By custom method \u00b6 When the external service does not provide any identifier, we have to use a custom method to generate one. It could be for example the filename or a hash generated with the document content. { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"id:\" : \"customhash34FED5465645ABF54656FCB\" } } } Saving document based on synchronization strategy \u00b6 To solve the synchronization process we need to: * be able to add synchronization data on any type of document * be able to compare external entries to current database state * provide a default implementation while letting the contributors to define their own ones Adding synchronization data \u00b6 We should provide an addSyncData function could, which look like this (naive implementation, this piece of code needs to be improved to handle cases where synchronizationStrategy.idAttribute is an array or a function): const addSyncData = ( document , entry , synchronizationStrategy ) => { return { ... document , metadata : { ... document . metadata , id : entry [ synchronizationStrategy . idAttribute ] } } ```` Where `document` is the future document to save , `entry` the corresponding external entry , and `synchronizationStrategy` and object defining the synchronization properties and methods ( see below ). ### Filtering entries Now we have saved our documents in database with consistent synchronization metadata , we need to provide a way to filter external entries . We should provide a `filterEntriesToSynchronize` which returns a list of entries with new data or data to update . As `addSyncData` , this method will receive a `synchronizationStrategy` . The filtering algorithm should be based on the returned value of `synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave` and `synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate` . > \u26a0\ufe0f As the `synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave` and `synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate` will be asynchronous methods , `filterEntriesToSynchronize` should also be asynchronous . A naive example of `filterEntriesToSynchronize` implementation should be : ```js const filterEntriesToSynchronize = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) = { const filtered = [] entries.forEach(entry => { // getExistingSynchronizedDocument needs to be implemented, it should retrieve // existing document from database, based on synchronization data. const existingDocument = cozy.getExistingSynchronizedDocument(entry, synchronizationStrategy) const toSave = await synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave(entry, existingDocument) const toUpdate = await synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate(entry, existingDocument) if (toSave || toUpdate) filtered.push(entry) }) return filtered } Synchronization strategy \u00b6 For our functions or methods dealing with synchronization, we pass a synchronizationStrategy object. Internally, we will use a default one but let the ability to contributors to pass their own ones. It is a simple object containing the following properties: Option Role disableSyncData (boolean) Disable storage of synchronization data. Default: false findLegacyDocument (function) Custom function which a konnector may use to look for a legacy document. Default is null . See below for more details. getSyncData (function) A mapping method returning additional synchronization data which have to be added to the document. idAttribute (string|Array|function) How the identifier attribute is named in the entry. Default value: id . See below for additional customization konnector Mandatory (string) The slug (or better, an uuid) of the current konnector. shouldSave (function) A method taking current entry and matching document in database to evaluate if an entry has to be saved in database. See below default method and customization. shouldUpdate (function) A method taking current entry and matching document in database to evaluate if a document must be updated with current entry. See below for default method and customization. findLegacyDocument \u00b6 If a document has not been saved yet with actual synchronization data, we will have no way to retrieve it, except by providing a findLegacyDocument function to saveEntry options. This signature of a findLegacyDocument function is: async function ( entry , cozy ) => { /* look for your document */ } ```` The `cozy` parameter is an instance of Cozy - Client . The idea is for example to retrive a document by its file path or any other accurate information . ### getSyncData This method returns any addtional synchronization data the konnector should need . Default method should be something returning an empty object or `null` . ```js (entry) => ({}) A konnector should provide its own method: { getSyncData : ( entry ) => ({ filename : entry . name }) } ``` ### idAttribute #### String Name of the id attribute in entry. Default is ` id `. If we want to use another name, we may use: ``` js saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : 'uuid' }) Array \u00b6 This attribute may also be an array of string, defining each entry attribute which must be used for identifier. Example \u00b6 saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : [ 'name' , 'author' , 'date' ]}) In this case, all fields are used in synchronization data. function \u00b6 When an entry does not provide an unique identifer, it is possible to use a function as idAttribute to customize the way the unique identifer is generated. Example \u00b6 addData ( file , { idAttribute : ( entry ) => hash ( entry )}) // hash() is a custom method hashing the current file. konnector \u00b6 The konnector attribute is used as a key reference to retrieve all document synchronized by this konnector. For now, the konnector option will be needed for every call. But it could be interesting to initialize some kind of runner with it, which may encapsulate all the cozy-konnector-libs functions. shouldSave \u00b6 The shouldSave function returns a boolean which indicate if the entry should be saved. The default method should be: async function shouldSave ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) => { return Promise . resolve ( ! existingDocument ) } When calling this function, it is assumed that cozy-konnector-libs first queries the database for an exisring document, based on synchronization data and pass the document resulting the query to the shouldSave function, event if this document is null . We pass the whole document, and not only synchronization data, to let the contributors free on their way they are determining it a document should be saved. As a third parameter, a cozyClient instance is passed, it may be used by a konnector to perform another query. Because of this third parameter, the whole shouldSave method is asynchronous. shouldUpdate \u00b6 The shouldUpdate function acts exactly like shouldSave , except that it is used to determine if a document should be updated. By default, we make the choice to never update a document (except if it does not have synchronization data, see findLegacyDocument above). But some konnectors like Linxo related ones need to update existing documents. The default method is: async function shouldUpdate ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) { // Update an existing document only if it does not have synchronization data const hasSyncData = !! existingDocument && !! existingDocument . metadata && !! existingDocument . metadata . sync return Promise . resolve ( ! hasSyncData ) } ```` ## Whole example As the way data are saved from `cozy-konnector-libs` differs based on data type , we let the saving mechanism to others functions or methods . For example , in existing codebase , bills are saved in a specific way , resulting in two documents in database . However , we could provide top - level functions or methods , like `synchronizeBills` or a more generic `synchronizeData` . Here is a whole and naive example of how `synchronizeBills` could be implemebted : ```js const synchronizeBills = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) => { return await filteredEntries = await filterEntriesToSynchronize(cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) .then(filteredEntries => filteredEntries.map(entry => addSyncData(entry, synchronizationStrategy))) // existing saveBills method (with maybe some little changes) .saveBills(synchronizedDocuments) } Usage could be: synchronizeBills(cozy, entries, { findLegacyDocument: (entry, cozy) => { return cozy.files.statByPath(getEntryPath(entry)) }, getSyncData: (file) => ({ fileName: file.name }), idAttribute: 'uuid', konnector: 'myservice', shouldSave: (file) => { // For whatever reason we only save files created after 2010 return Promise.resolve(moment(file.creationDate).year().isAfter(2010)) }, shouldUpdate: (file, existingDocument) => { const hasBeenModified = moment(file.modificationDate).isAfter(existingDocument.metadata.sync.last_sync) return Promise.resolve(hasBeenModified) } }) Every synchronized document will contain: { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"konnector\" : \"myservice\" , \"id\" : \"<entry_id>\" , \"last_sync\" : \"<now>\" , \"fileName\" : \"<fileName>\" } } }","title":"Synchronization"},{"location":"cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#table-of-contents","text":"Konnector synchronisation data and options Problems Current usage Objectives of this document Storing synchronization data in documents Simple case, by id By multiple attributes By custom method Saving document based on synchronization strategy Adding synchronization data Filtering entries Synchronization strategy findLegacyDocument getSyncData Array Example function Example konnector shouldSave shouldUpdate Whole example","title":"Table of contents"},{"location":"cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#konnector-synchronisation-data-and-options","text":"","title":"Konnector synchronisation data and options"},{"location":"cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#problems","text":"Except bank konnectors which are already solving the addressed problem, all konnectors are currently processing data they are collecting in the same way: Get all data to synchronize Store it in CouchDB, even if it means overriding previously synchronized data.

Targets webpack.target.browser.js webpack.target.mobile.js Miscellaneous webpack.vars.js Introduction \u00b6 To build a Cozy application, cozy-scripts uses webpack under the hood, and this documentation is dedicated to all webpack configuration files. In order to organize all these webpack configurations, they are classified in many files according to the concern. Having many unit files for the configuration will also allow to support specific application needs without \u2018ejecting\u2019 (removing cozy-scripts dependency and copy all webpack configurations and dependencies to the application repository). These files are supposed to be enoughly independant to be usable upon request as far as possible without conflicts. Kind of config file: \u00b6 Bundle: A bundle regroup many unit configuration for a specific use case like the default React application or an VueJS application. Environment: An environment config is in charge of provided variables and pluging specific to a compiling context (development or production for example). Target: A target means the one which will use the built. For now we only have to targets, browser for the default web application and mobile for the native mobile application using Cordova (in progress). Bundles \u00b6 webpack.bundle.default.js \u00b6 This file is the default config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts . It uses all following configs files: - webpack.config.base.js - webpack.config.chunks.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js - webpack.config.eslint.js - webpack.config.intents.js - webpack.config.manifest.js - webpack.config.pictures.js - webpack.config.progress.js - webpack.config.react.js - webpack.config.vendors.js - webpack.environment.dev.js - webpack.environment.prod.js - webpack.target.browser.js - webpack.target.mobile.js - webpack.vars.js By default cozy-scripts uses this bundle in an opinionated way, but you can overload this configuration by creating a custom app.config.js in your application root directory: // app.config.js // using ES Modules import configs from 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.default.js' import myConfig from './config/webpack.myconfig.js' // or using CommonJS const configs = require ( 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.default.js' ) const myConfig = require ( './config/webpack.myconfig.js' ) // it's possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] webpack.bundle.preact.js \u00b6 This file is the same default bundle but using preact instead (previous default config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts ). It uses all following configs files: - webpack.config.base.js - webpack.config.chunks.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js - webpack.config.eslint.js - webpack.config.intents.js - webpack.config.manifest.js - webpack.config.pictures.js - webpack.config.preact.js - webpack.config.progress.js - webpack.config.vendors.js - webpack.environment.dev.js - webpack.environment.prod.js - webpack.target.browser.js - webpack.target.mobile.js - webpack.vars.js This config will replace react usage by preact-compat in a transparent manner (webpack aliases). The app.config.js is needed to use this bundle since it\u2019s not the default one for cozy-scripts . But you can still overload it using a custom config like the default bundle: // app.config.js // using ES Modules import configs from 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.preact.js' import myConfig from './config/webpack.myconfig.js' // or using CommonJS const configs = require ( 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.preact.js' ) const myConfig = require ( './config/webpack.myconfig.js' ) // it's possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] webpack.bundle.vue.js \u00b6 This file is the VueJS config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts with the option --vue . It uses all following configs files: - webpack.config.base.js - webpack.config.chunks.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.js - webpack.config.eslint.js - webpack.config.intents.js - webpack.config.manifest.js - webpack.config.pictures.js - webpack.config.progress.js - webpack.config.vendors.js - webpack.config.vue.js - webpack.environment.dev.js - webpack.environment.prod.js - webpack.target.browser.js - webpack.target.mobile.js - webpack.vars.js You can still overload it using a custom config like the default bundle using the app.config.js file: // app.config.js // ES Modules import configs from 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.vue.js' import myConfig from './config/webpack.myconfig.js' // or CommonJS const configs = require ( 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.vue.js' ) const myConfig = require ( './config/webpack.myconfig.js' ) // it's possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] Unit Configs \u00b6 webpack.config.analyzer.js \u00b6 This file will only add the plugin webpack-bundle-analyzer to be run on with the --analyzer option. It will run a server (on port 8889 to not be in conflict with the webpack dev server) and open an interactive treemap visualization of the contents of all your bundles in your browser. webpack.config.base.js \u00b6 The default basic configuration of the application. Properties \u00b6 output to [name].js filename resolve: modules to ['node_modules', 'src'] extensions: .js , .json and .css Rules \u00b6 all .js (excluding node_modules , cozy-bar and cozy-client-js ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) all .css to be loaded using options: mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading css-loader with sourceMap postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } A specific noParse property is enabled on /localforage/dist . Plugins: \u00b6 postcss-assets-webpack-plugin (logs from this plugin are shown only in --debug mode) to load all .css files with: css-mqpacker (pack all CSS media query rules into one) postcss-discard-duplicates (remove duplicates) postcss-discard-empty (remove empty definitions) csswring only in production environment to minify and remove comments ( preservehacks enabled) webpack.config.chunks.js \u00b6 This configuration will use the optimization property with splitChunks in order to split the build into two chunks: - The main one, it can be app or intents - And the vendors chunk which will gather all stuff from node_modules Splitting chunks allow to decrease the size of the main chunk and optimize the build for caching (mainly the main chunk will change during development). webpack.config.cozy-ui.js \u00b6 This configuration will allow to load styles from cozy-ui . It adds a rule for all .styl files excluding node_modules and node_modules/cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with sourceMap - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader using the custom stylus plugin from cozy-ui as option It also uses svg-sprite-loader/plugin to merge the built svg sprite from cozy-ui into the application\u2019s one webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js \u00b6 This configuration is specific to react components usage from cozy-ui , since they currently need css-modules . This configuration file could be removed if this cozy-ui requirement disappear. It adds a rule for all .styl files from cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with modules , sourceMap and [local]--[hash:base64:5] as localIdentName - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader using the custom stylus plugin from cozy-ui as option webpack.config.css-modules.js \u00b6 This configuration will allow to use css-modules with stylus files. To overload previous stylus loaders, it uses the following webpack-merge smartStrategy : { 'modules.loaders': 'replace' } . It adds a rule for all .styl files excluding node_modules and node_modules/cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with modules , sourceMap and [local]--[hash:base64:5] as localIdentName - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader webpack.config.eslint.js \u00b6 A rule to preload all .js/.jsx files with eslint-loader (excluding node_modules ) extending babel-preset-cozy-app The emitWarning option is set to true for production environment or if hot reload is enabled to force emitting warning and to avoid errors breaking the build. webpack.config.intents.js \u00b6 This is a specific configuration file to develop application intents for the Cozy platform. It will: - add a webpack entry: the babel-polyfill import and the src/targets/intents/intents.jsx file - use html-webpack-plugin configured to use index.ejs HTML template from src/targets/intents/ with options: - title : name property of the package.json + intents - filename : intents/index.html , the output file - excludeChunks : to exclude chunk app - inject to false - minify with collapseWhitespace to true webpack.config.hash.js \u00b6 A custom webpack plugin usage to extract the hash from built files for reference. webpack.config.manifest.js \u00b6 A copy-webpack-plugin plugin usage to copy the manifest.webapp , README.md and LICENSE files to the output build folder. In the production environment, the manifest.webapp is transformed to include locales from the application src/locales folder (locales concerning manifest descriptions, permissions, names\u2026). It will look for the manifest property (if found) of the locale .json file. So the locales property of the manifest.webapp will be an object of language slugs as properties and each slug matching the related locales found. The langs array in the manifest will also be computed according to the languages found in src/locales . Except for production environment, the manifest.webapp is transformed using a custom function to change the slug property value to app (to keep using app.cozy.tools:8080 URL for different app development). webpack.config.pictures.js \u00b6 This configuration will handle all pictures files. It will add two rules: - all .svg files in sprites/ and icons/ folders will be loaded using svg-sprite-loader with output name to [name]_[hash] . This loader will merge all SVG content to one .svg file and replace their reference to the matching id . Only one .svg sprite file will be loaded by the ouput application. - all other .svg , .png , .gif , .jpg , .jpeg files will be loaded using file-loader with options: - path to img , the ouput folder - symbolId to [name].[hash].[ext] for production environment, [name].[ext] for other environments It also adds svg-sprite-loader/plugin as plugin to use it with the related loader. webpack.config.preact.js \u00b6 A config to resolve all react aliases using Preact instead. It will: - resolve .jsx extensions - add aliases: - react to preact-compat - react-dom to preact-compat - Due to an HMR issue , preact-compat to preact-compat/dist/preact-compat - add a rule for .jsx files excluding node_modules (exception for node_modules/cozy-ui ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) webpack.config.progress.js \u00b6 This config will just add a custom webpack plugin to display a progress bar when webpack building/watching. It internally uses the included webpack plugin webpack.ProgressPlugin . webpack.config.services.js \u00b6 This config will provide a separate config to build app services using Webpack multi-compiling . In this case, all services files ( .js files in the /src/targets/services/ folder) will be built using this separate webpack config. This config will: - use __mergeStrategy to drive the webpack-merge strategy : - disable smart merging - use the replace mode plugins , output , entry , optimization and module - define as webpack entry an array of all .js files contained in /src/target/services folder - use as output the /build/services folder with [name].js as filename - define the target as 'node' - disable devtool (boolean to false ) - define the global variable __TARGET__ to services using the plugin webpack.DefinePlugin This config will be used only if the webpack target is browser . webpack.config.react.js \u00b6 A config to load .jsx using for React components. It will: - resolve .jsx extensions - add a rule for .jsx files excluding node_modules (exception for node_modules/cozy-ui ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) webpack.config.vendors.js \u00b6 A copy-webpack-plugin plugin usage to copy all files from the vendors/assets/ folder to the output build folder. This config will also process the application icon and run svgo to optimize it if this is a SVG file. webpack.config.vue.js \u00b6 A config to use the VueJS (v2+) framework. It will: - resolve .vue extensions - add a rule for .vue files, excluding node_modules , to be loaded using vue-loader . Environments \u00b6 webpack.environment.dev.js \u00b6 Properties \u00b6 devtool to #source-map externals with ['cozy'] to exclude all cozy.* dependencies from the output bundle (since it will be serve by ProvidePlugin ) mode to development Plugins: \u00b6 webpack.DefinePlugin to define globals variables at compiling time: __DEVELOPMENT__ to true __STACK_ASSETS__ to false webpack.ProvidePlugin to provide cozy-bar and cozy-client-js from node_modules (in production, these modules will be provided to the application by the cozy-stack ) Copy ( copy-webpack-plugin ) the cozy-bar.css file from node_modules ot the app build to be able to develop on the cozy-bar using the app Add the cozy-bar css to the main html file via html-webpack-include-assets-plugin Only in the hot reload mode: - webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin which allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the need for a full refresh - write-file-webpack-plugin to write all the build file from webpack-dev-server to the disk (necessary for the hot-reloading) webpack.environment.prod.js \u00b6 Plugins: \u00b6 webpack.optimize.OccurrenceOrderPlugin webpack.DefinePlugin to define globals variables at compiling time: process.env.NODE_ENV to production __DEVELOPMENT__ to false __DEVTOOLS__ to false __STACK_ASSETS__ to true if target different from mobile In this production mode, webpack will automatically use the Terser plugin to optimize the build (with parallel: true to speedup the build).

There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them. Security Issues \u00b6 If you discover a security issue, please bring it to their attention right away! Please DO NOT file a public issue, instead send your report privately to security AT cozycloud DOT cc. Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it. We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but are not ruling it out in the future. Bug Reports \u00b6 While bugs are unfortunate, they\u2019re a reality in software. We can\u2019t fix what we don\u2019t know about, so please report liberally. If you\u2019re not sure if something is a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway. Opening an issue is as easy as following this link and filling out the fields. Here are some things you can write about your bug: A short summary What did you try, step by step? What did you expect? What did happen instead? What is the version of the Cozy Stack? You can also use the cozy-stack bug command to open the form to report issue prefilled with some useful system informations. Pull Requests \u00b6 Workflow \u00b6 Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change Cozy. GitHub itself has some great documentation on using the Pull Request feature. We use the \u2018fork and pull\u2019 model described there. Step 1: Fork \u00b6 Fork the project on GitHub and check out your copy locally: \u26a0\ufe0f Be sure to clone outside the $GOPATH otherwise gomodules will not work (or use the GO111MODULE=on env variable to force the usage of go modules). $ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack.git $ cd cozy-stack $ git remote add fork git://github.com/username/cozy-stack.git Step 2: Branch \u00b6 Create a branch and start hacking: $ git checkout -b my-branch -t origin/master Step 3: Code \u00b6 Well, I think you know how to do that. Just be sure to follow the coding guidelines from the Go community (gofmt, Effective Go , comment the code, etc.). We are using goimports to format code, and golangci-lint to detect code smells. We are using eslint to lint JavaScript code. The linting rules are based on cozy-app Step 4: Test \u00b6 Don\u2019t forget to add tests and be sure they are green: $ go test -v ./... If you want to play with the modified cozy-stack (for example, testing it with a webapp), you can build it locally and start it with this command: $ go build && ./cozy-stack serve Step 5: Commit \u00b6 Writing good commit messages is important. A commit message should describe what changed and why. Step 6: Rebase \u00b6 Use git pull --rebase , or git rebase (but not git merge ), to sync your work from time to time: $ git pull origin master --rebase Step 7: Push \u00b6 $ git push fork my-branch Go to https://github.com/username/cozy-stack and select your branch. Click the \u2018Pull Request\u2019 button and fill out the form. Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days. If there are comments to address, apply your changes in a separate commit and push that to your branch. Code organization \u00b6 The codebase of cozy-stack contains several packages, and it is quite easy to have circular import issues in go. To limit the risk, we have split the packages in several directories with some rules for the imports. In short, a package in this list should import other packages that are on the same line or below: main and cmd are the top level packages web is where we have the routers and handlers for web requests worker is where we define the workers for our job system model is for high-level internal packages (in general one package is used for one doctype) client is a small number of packages used for writing clients for the stack pkg is the low-level packages (most of those packages are just a couple of structs and functions). Note that tests/testutils can be used safely in web and worker packages. In model , it can be used but it is recommended to use a fake package for the tests if it is the case. For example, model/oauth/client_test.go is declared as package oauth_test . External assets \u00b6 The cozy-stack serve some assets for the client application. In particular, cozy-client-js and cozy-bar assets are listed in assets/external . To update them, you can open a pull request for this file. When a maintainer will accept this pull request, he will also run scripts/build.sh assets to transform them in go code (to make the repository go gettable). Useful commands \u00b6 There are some useful commands to know in order to develop with the go code of cozy-stack: cd cozy-stack go build # Build the stack, also takes care of updating dependencies through gomodules go install # Installs the `cozy-stack` binary go test -v ./... # To launch the tests go run main.go serve # To start the API server godoc -http = :6060 # To start the documentation server # Open http://127.0.0.1:6060/pkg/github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/ Writing documentation \u00b6 Documentation improvements are very welcome. We try to keep a good documentation in the docs/ folder. But, you know, we are developers, we can forget to document important stuff that look obvious to us. And documentation can always be improved. Translations \u00b6 The Cozy Stack is translated on a platform called Transifex . This tutorial can help you to learn how to make your first steps here. If you have any question, don\u2019t hesitate to ask us! The translations are kept synchronized with transifex via their github integration. Community \u00b6 You can help us by making our community even more vibrant. For example, you can write a blog post, take some videos, answer the questions on the forum , organize new meetups, and speak about what you like in Cozy!","title":"The contributing guide"},{"location":"cozy-stack/CONTRIBUTING/#how-to-contribute-to-the-cozy-stack","text":"Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cozy!

Assuming CouchDB is installed and running on default port 5984 , you can start the server: cozy-stack serve And then create an instance for development: cozy-stack instances add --apps home,drive,settings,store --passphrase cozy \"cozy.tools:8080\" The cozy-stack server listens on http://cozy.tools:8080/ by default. See cozy-stack --help for more informations. The above command will create an instance on http://cozy.tools:8080/ with the passphrase cozy . By default this will create a storage/ entry in your current directory, containing all your instances by their URL. An instance \u201ccozy.tools:8080\u201d will have its stored files in storage/cozy.tools:8080/ . Installed apps will be found in the .cozy_apps/ directory of each instance.

applications from the cozy stack and serve them via cozy stack. The stack does the routing and serve the HTML and the assets for the applications. The assets of the applications are installed in the virtual file system. Install an application \u00b6 The manifest \u00b6 To install an application, cozy needs a manifest. It\u2019s a JSON document that describes the application (its name and icon for example), how to install it and what it needs for its usage (the permissions in particular). While we have considered to use the same manifest format as the W3C for PWAs , it didn\u2019t match our expectations. The manifest format for FirefoxOS is a better fit. We took a lot of inspirations from it, starting with the filename for this file: manifest.webapp . Field Description name the name to display on the home name_prefix the prefix to display with the name slug the default slug (it can be changed at install time) editor the editor\u2019s name to display on the cozy-bar of the app icon an icon for the home screenshots an array of path to the screenshots of the application category the category of the application short_description a short description of the application long_description a long description of the application source where the files of the app can be downloaded developer name and url for the developer locales translations of the name and description fields in other locales langs list of languages tags supported by the application version the current version number license the SPDX license identifier platforms a list of type , url values for derivate of the application for other devices intents a list of intents provided by this app (see here for more details) permissions a map of permissions needed by the app (see here for more details) notifications a map of notifications needed by the app (see here for more details) services a map of the services associated with the app (see below for more details) routes a map of routes for the app (see below for more details) Routes \u00b6 A route make the mapping between the requested paths and the files. It can have an index, which is an HTML file, with a token injected on it that identify the application. This token must be used with the user cookies to use the services of the cozy-stack (except in the cases of a shared by link page). By default, a route can be only visited by the authenticated owner of the instance where the app is installed. But a route can be marked as public. In that case, anybody can visit the route. For example, an application can offer an administration interface on /admin , a public page on /public , and shared assets in /assets : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public-assets\" , \"public\" : true } } If an application has no routes in its manifest, the stack will create one route, this default one: { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false } } Note : if you have a public route, it\u2019s probably better to put the app icon in it. So, the cozy-bar can display it for the users that go on the public part of the app. When the stack receives a request, it chooses the more specific route that matches, then it looks inside the associated folder to find the file, and send it. If the route is an exact match, the file will be the index, and it will be interpreted as a template, cf the list of variables . For example, with the previous routes, a request to /admin will use the file /admin.html as a template for the response. And a request to /assets/css/theme.css will use the file /public-assets/css/theme.css . Services \u00b6 Application may require background and offline process to analyse the user\u2019s data and emit some notification or warning even without the user being on the application. These part of the application are called services and can be declared as part of the application in its manifest. In contrast to konnectors , services have the same permissions as the web application and are not intended to collect outside informations but rather analyse the current set of collected information inside the cozy. However they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they should be executed: via our trigger system. To define a service, first the code needs to be stored with the application content, as single (packaged) javascript files. In the manifest, declare the service and its parameters following this example: { \"services\" : { \"low-budget-notification\" : { \"type\" : \"node\" , \"file\" : \"/services/low-budget-notification.js\" , \"trigger\" : \"@cron 0 0 0 * * *\" } // ... } } The trigger field should follow the available triggers described in the jobs documentation . The file field should specify the service code run and the type field describe the code type (only \"node\" for now). Available fields to the service \u00b6 During the service execution, the stack will give some environment variables to the service if you need to use them. - \"COZY_URL\" # Cozy URL - \"COZY_CREDENTIALS\" # The cozy app related token - \"COZY_LANGUAGE\" # Lang used for the service (ex: node) - \"COZY_LOCALE\" # Locale of the Cozy - \"COZY_TIME_LIMIT\" # Maximum execution time. After this, the job will be killed - \"COZY_JOB_ID\" # Job ID - \"COZY_COUCH_DOC\" # The CouchDB document which triggers the service Notifications \u00b6 For more informations on how te declare notifications in the manifest, see the notifications documentation . Here is an example: { \"notifications\" : { \"account-balance\" : { \"description\" : \"Alert the user when its account balance is negative\" , \"collapsible\" : true , // only interested in the last value of the notification \"multiple\" : true , // require sub-categories for each account \"stateful\" : false , \"default_priority\" : \"high\" , // high priority for this notification \"templates\" : { \"mail\" : \"file:./notifications/account-balance-mail.tpl\" } } } } Resource caching \u00b6 To help caching of applications assets, we detect the presence of a unique identifier in the name of assets: a unique identifier is matched when the file base name contains a long hexadecimal subpart between \u2018.\u2019, of at least 10 characters. For instance app.badf00dbadf00d.js or icon.badbeefbadbeef.1.png . With such a unique identifier, the asset is considered immutable, and a long cache-control is added on corresponding HTTP responses. We recommend the use of bundling tools like webpack which offer the possibility to add such identifier on the building step of the application packages for all assets. Sources \u00b6 Here is the available sources, defined by the scheme of the source URL: registry:// : to install an application from the instance registries git:// , git+ssh:// , or git+https:// : to install an application from a git repository http:// or https:// : to install an application from an http server (via a tarball) file:// : to install an application from a local directory (for instance: file:///home/user/code/cozy-app ) The registry scheme expect the following elements: scheme: registry host: the name of the application path: /:channel the channel of the application (see the registry doc) Examples: registry://drive/stable , registry://drive/beta , and registry://drive/dev . For the git scheme, the fragment in the URL can be used to specify which branch to install. For the http and https schemes, the fragment can be used to give the expected sha256sum. POST /apps/:slug \u00b6 Install an application, ie download the files and put them in /apps/:slug in the virtual file system of the user, create an io.cozy.apps document, register the permissions, etc. This endpoint is asynchronous and returns a successful return as soon as the application installation has started, meaning we have successfully reached the manifest and started to fetch application data. To make this endpoint synchronous, use the header Accept: text/event-stream . This will make a eventsource stream sending the manifest and returning when the application has been installed or failed. Status codes \u00b6 202 Accepted, when the application installation has been accepted. 400 Bad-Request, when the manifest of the application could not be processed (for instance, it is not valid JSON). 404 Not Found, when the manifest or the source of the application is not reachable. 422 Unprocessable Entity, when the sent data is invalid (for example, the slug is invalid or the Source parameter is not a proper or supported url) Query-String \u00b6 Parameter Description Source URL from where the app can be downloaded (only for install) The Source parameter is optional: by default, the stable channel of the registry will be used.

It is useful if there are newer permissions or Terms Of Service and you want to be sure they were read or accepted. If set to false , the update will be blocked and the user will be told that a new app version is available.\\ > Note: PermissionsAcked can be skipped. \\ If an instance is in a context configured with the parameter permissions_skip_verification sets to true , permissions verification will be ignored. Source (defaults to SourceURL installation parameter): Use a different source to update this app (e.g. to install a beta or dev app version) Examples: \u00b6 You have an email application on a stable channel, and you want to update it to a particular beta version: PUT /apps/emails?Source=https://<apps-repository>/emails/1.0.0-beta HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json You want to attempt the email app update, but prevent it if new permissions were added PUT /apps/emails?PermissionsAcked=false HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json You can combine these parameters to use a precise app version and stay on another channel (when permissions are different): Install a version (e.g. 1.0.0 ) Ask an update to stable channel with PermissionsAcked to false Source will be stable , and your version remains 1.0.0 List installed applications \u00b6 GET /apps/ \u00b6 An application can be in one of these states: installed , the application is installed but still require some user interaction to accept its permissions ready , the user can use it installing , the installation is running and the app will soon be usable upgrading , a new version is being installed errored , the app is in an error state and can not be used.

The sub-domain is the slug used when installing the application ( calendar.cozy.example.org if it was installed via a POST on /apps/calendar). On the main domain ( cozy.example.org ), there will be the registration process, the login form, and it will redirect to home.cozy.example.org for logged-in users. Rationale \u00b6 The applications have different roles and permissions. An application is identified when talking to the stack via a token. The token has to be injected in the application, one way or another, and it have to be unaccessible from other apps. If the applications run on the same domain (for example https://cozy.example.org/apps/calendar ), it\u2019s nearly impossible to protect an application to take the token of another application. The security model of the web is based too heavily on Same Origin Policy for that. If the token is put in the html of the index.html page of an app, another app can use the fetch API to get the html page, parse its content and extract the token. We can think of other ways to inject the token (indexeddb, URL, cookies) but none will provide a better isolation. Maybe in a couple years, when the origin spec will be more advanced. So, if having the apps on the same origin is not possible, we have to put them on several origins. One interesting way to do that is using sandboxed iframes. An iframe with the sandbox attribute , and not allow-same-origin in it, will be assigned to a unique origin. The W3C warns: Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the file containing the iframe element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal help if an attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content directly, rather than in the iframe. To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be served from a separate dedicated domain. Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the files are unable to attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages directly, without the protection of the sandbox attribute. It may be possible to disable all html pages to have an html content-type, except the home, and having the home loading the apps in a sandboxed iframe, via the srcdoc attribute. But, it will mean that we will have to reinvent nearly everything. Even showing an image can no longer be done via an <img> tag, it will need to use post-message with the home. Such a solution is difficult to implement, is a very fragile (both for the apps developer than for security) and is an hell to debug when it breaks. Clearly, it\u2019s not an acceptable solution. Thus, the only choice is to have several origins, and sub-domains is the best way for that. Of course, it has the downside to be more complicated to deploy (DNS and TLS certificates). But, in the tradeoff between security and ease of administration, we definetively take the security first. Routes \u00b6 Should we be concerned that all the routes are on the same sub-domain? No, it\u2019s not an issue. There are two types of routes: the ones that are publics and those reserved to the authenticated user. Public routes have no token Private routes are private, they can be accessed only with a valid session cookie, ie by the owner of the instance. Another application can\u2019t use the user cookies to read the token, because of the restrictions of the same origin policy (they are on different domains). And the application can\u2019t use an open proxy to read the private route, because it doesn\u2019t have the user cookies for that (the cookie is marked as httpOnly ).","title":"/apps - Applications Management"},{"location":"cozy-stack/apps/#applications","text":"It\u2019s possible to manage serverless applications from the cozy stack and serve them via cozy stack.

It\u2019s a JSON document that describes the application (its name and icon for example), how to install it and what it needs for its usage (the permissions in particular). While we have considered to use the same manifest format as the W3C for PWAs , it didn\u2019t match our expectations. The manifest format for FirefoxOS is a better fit. We took a lot of inspirations from it, starting with the filename for this file: manifest.webapp .

It can have an index, which is an HTML file, with a token injected on it that identify the application. This token must be used with the user cookies to use the services of the cozy-stack (except in the cases of a shared by link page). By default, a route can be only visited by the authenticated owner of the instance where the app is installed. But a route can be marked as public. In that case, anybody can visit the route. For example, an application can offer an administration interface on /admin , a public page on /public , and shared assets in /assets : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public-assets\" , \"public\" : true } } If an application has no routes in its manifest, the stack will create one route, this default one: { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false } } Note : if you have a public route, it\u2019s probably better to put the app icon in it. So, the cozy-bar can display it for the users that go on the public part of the app. When the stack receives a request, it chooses the more specific route that matches, then it looks inside the associated folder to find the file, and send it. If the route is an exact match, the file will be the index, and it will be interpreted as a template, cf the list of variables . For example, with the previous routes, a request to /admin will use the file /admin.html as a template for the response.

An application is identified when talking to the stack via a token. The token has to be injected in the application, one way or another, and it have to be unaccessible from other apps. If the applications run on the same domain (for example https://cozy.example.org/apps/calendar ), it\u2019s nearly impossible to protect an application to take the token of another application. The security model of the web is based too heavily on Same Origin Policy for that. If the token is put in the html of the index.html page of an app, another app can use the fetch API to get the html page, parse its content and extract the token. We can think of other ways to inject the token (indexeddb, URL, cookies) but none will provide a better isolation. Maybe in a couple years, when the origin spec will be more advanced. So, if having the apps on the same origin is not possible, we have to put them on several origins. One interesting way to do that is using sandboxed iframes. An iframe with the sandbox attribute , and not allow-same-origin in it, will be assigned to a unique origin. The W3C warns: Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the file containing the iframe element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal help if an attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content directly, rather than in the iframe. To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be served from a separate dedicated domain. Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the files are unable to attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages directly, without the protection of the sandbox attribute. It may be possible to disable all html pages to have an html content-type, except the home, and having the home loading the apps in a sandboxed iframe, via the srcdoc attribute. But, it will mean that we will have to reinvent nearly everything. Even showing an image can no longer be done via an <img> tag, it will need to use post-message with the home. Such a solution is difficult to implement, is a very fragile (both for the apps developer than for security) and is an hell to debug when it breaks. Clearly, it\u2019s not an acceptable solution. Thus, the only choice is to have several origins, and sub-domains is the best way for that. Of course, it has the downside to be more complicated to deploy (DNS and TLS certificates). But, in the tradeoff between security and ease of administration, we definetively take the security first.","title":"Rationale"},{"location":"cozy-stack/apps/#routes_1","text":"Should we be concerned that all the routes are on the same sub-domain?

When the cozy-stack receives a request, it checks that the request is authorized, and if yes, it processes it and answers it. What about OAuth2? \u00b6 OAuth2 is about delegating an access to resources on a server to another party. It is a framework, not a strictly defined protocol, for organizing the interactions between these 4 actors: the resource owner, the \u201cuser\u201d that can click on buttons the client, the website or application that would like to access the resources the authorization server, whose role is limited to give tokens but is central in OAuth2 interactions the resources server, the server that controls the resources. For cozy, both the authorization server and the resources server roles are played by the cozy-stack. The resource owner is the owner of a cozy instance. The client can be the cozy-desktop app, cozy-mobile, or many other applications. OAuth2, and its extensions, is a large world. At its core, there is 2 things: letting the client get a token issued by the authorization server, and using this token to access to the resources. OAuth2 describe 4 flows, called grant types, for the first part: Authorization code Implicit grant type Client credentials grant type Resource owner credentials grant type. On cozy, only the most typical one is used: authorization code. To start this flow, the client must have a client_id and client_secret . The Cozy stack implements the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (an extension to OAuth2) to allow the clients to obtain them. OAuth2 has also 3 ways to use a token: in the query-string (even if the spec does not recommended it) in the POST body in the HTTP Authorization header. On cozy, only the HTTP header is supported. OAuth2 has a lot of assumptions. Let\u2019s see some of them and their consequences on Cozy: TLS is very important to secure the communications. in OAuth 1, there was a mechanism to sign the requests. But it was very difficult to get it right for the developers and was abandonned in OAuth2, in favor of using TLS. The Cozy instance are already accessible only in HTTPS, so there is nothing particular to do for that. There is a principle called TOFU, Trust On First Use. It said that if the user will give his permission for delegating access to its resources when the client will try to access them for the first time. Later, the client will be able to keep accessing them even if the user is no longer here to give his permissions. The client can\u2019t make the assumptions about when its tokens will work. The tokens have no meaning for him (like cookies in a browser), they are just something it got from the authorization server and can send with its request. The access token can expire, the user can revoke them, etc. OAuth 2.0 defines no cryptographic methods. But a developer that want to use it will have to put her hands in that. If you want to learn OAuth 2 in details, I recommend the OAuth 2 in Action book . The cozy stack as an authorization server \u00b6 In general, the cozy stack manages the authentication itself. This is what is described below. In some special cases, an integration with other softwares can be mandatory: this is possible to configure via delegated authentication . GET /auth/login \u00b6 Display a form with a password field to let the user authenticates herself to the cozy stack. This endpoint accepts a redirect parameter. If the user is already logged in, she will be redirected immediately. Else, the parameter will be transfered in the POST. This parameter can only contain a link to an application installed on the cozy (thus to a subdomain of the cozy instance). To protect against stealing authorization code with redirection, the fragment is always overriden: GET /auth/login?redirect=https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo?bar#baz HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : ... Note : the redirect parameter should be URL-encoded. We haven\u2019t done that to make it clear what the path ( foo ), the query-string ( bar ), and the fragment ( baz ) are. HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo?bar# If the redirect parameter is invalid, the response will be 400 Bad Request . Same for other parameters, the redirection will happen only on success (even if OAuth2 says the authorization server can redirect on errors, it\u2019s very complicated to do it safely, and it is better to avoid this trap). POST /auth/login \u00b6 After the user has typed her passphrase and clicked on Login , a request is made to this endpoint. The redirect parameter is passed inside the body. If it is missing, the redirection will be made against the default target: the home application of this cozy instance. POST /auth/login HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded passphrase=p4ssw0rd&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcontacts.cozy.example.org HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Set-Cookie : ... Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo When two-factor authentication (2FA) authentication is activated, this endpoint will not directly sent a redirection after this first passphrase step. In such case, a 200 OK response is sent along with a token value in the response (either in JSON if requested or directly in a new HTML form). Along with this token, on 2FA passcode is sent to the user via another transport (email for instance, depending on the user\u2019s preferences). Another request should be sent to /auth/twofactor with a valid pair (token, passcode) , ensuring that the user correctly entered its passphrase and received a fresh passcode by another mean. POST /auth/twofactor \u00b6 POST /auth/twofactor HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded two-factor-token=123123123123&two-factor-passcode=678678&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcontacts.cozy.example.org HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Set-Cookie : ... Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo DELETE /auth/login \u00b6 This can be used to log-out the user.

DELETE /auth/login HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : seesioncookie....

DELETE /auth/login/others HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : seesioncookie....

POST /auth/hint HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org POST /auth/passphrase_reset \u00b6 After the user has clicked on the reset button of the passphrase reset form, it will execute a request to this endpoint. This endpoint will create a token for the user to actually renew his passphrase. The token has a short-live duration of about 15 minutes. After the token is created, it is sent to the user on its mailbox. This endpoint will redirect the user on the login form page. POST /auth/passphrase_reset HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded csrf_token=123456890 GET /auth/passphrase_renew \u00b6 Display a form for the user to enter a new password.

POST /auth/passphrase_renew \u00b6 After the user has entered its new passphrase in the renew passphrase form, a request is made to this endpoint to renew the passphrase.

It can also send the optional fields: client_kind (possible values: web, desktop, mobile, browser, etc.) client_uri , URL string of a web page providing information about the client logo_uri , to display an icon to the user in the authorization flow policy_uri , URL string that points to a human-readable privacy policy document that describes how the deployment organization collects, uses, retains, and discloses personal data software_version , a version identifier string for the client software. notification_platform , to activate notifications on the associated device, this field specify the platform used to send notifications: \"android\" : for Android devices with notifications via Firebase Cloud Messageing \"ios\" : for iOS devices with notifications via APNS/2. notification_device_token , the token used to identify the mobile device for notifications The server gives to the client the previous fields and these informations: client_id client_secret registration_access_token Example: POST /auth/register HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/json Accept : application/json { \"redirect_uris\" : [ \"https://client.example.org/oauth/callback\" ], \"client_name\" : \"Client\" , \"software_id\" : \"github.com/example/client\" , \"software_version\" : \"2.0.1\" , \"client_kind\" : \"web\" , \"client_uri\" : \"https://client.example.org/\" , \"logo_uri\" : \"https://client.example.org/logo.svg\" , \"policy_uri\" : \"https://client/example.org/policy\" } HTTP / 1.1 201 Created Content-Type : application/json { \"client_id\" : \"64ce5cb0-bd4c-11e6-880e-b3b7dfda89d3\" , \"client_secret\" : \"eyJpc3Mi[...omitted for brevity...]\" , \"client_secret_expires_at\" : 0 , \"registration_access_token\" : \"J9l-ZhwP[...omitted for brevity...]\" , \"grant_types\" : [ \"authorization_code\" , \"refresh_token\" ], \"response_types\" : [ \"code\" ], \"redirect_uris\" : [ \"https://client.example.org/oauth/callback\" ], \"client_name\" : \"Client\" , \"software_id\" : \"github.com/example/client\" , \"software_version\" : \"2.0.1\" , \"client_kind\" : \"web\" , \"client_uri\" : \"https://client.example.org/\" , \"logo_uri\" : \"https://client.example.org/logo.svg\" , \"policy_uri\" : \"https://client/example.org/policy\" } Linked applications \u00b6 Some OAuth applications are a mobile or desktop version of a Cozy webapp. For them, it\u2019s possible to use a special software_id to make a link between the mobile/desktop application and the webapp. The software_id must be in a registry://slug format, like registry://drive for Cozy-Drive for example. When it is the case, the mobile/desktop will share its permissions with the webapp. It means several things: The mobile/desktop app will have the same permissions that the linked webapp. When a sharing by link is done in the mobile/desktop application, the linked webapp will be able to revoke it later, and vice versa. When the user accepts to give access to its Cozy to the mobile/desktop app, the linked webapp will be installed on the Cozy if it was not already the case. When the linked webapp is uninstalled, the right to access the Cozy for the mobile/desktop app will be revoked. GET /auth/register/:client-id \u00b6 This route is used by the clients to get informations about them-selves. The client has to send its registration access token to be able to use this endpoint.

HTTP / 1.1 204 No Content Content-Type : application/json GET /auth/authorize \u00b6 When an OAuth2 client wants to get access to the data of the cozy owner, it starts the OAuth2 dance with this step. The user is shown what the client asks and has an accept button if she is OK with that. The parameters are: client_id , that identify the client redirect_uri , it has to be exactly the same as the one used in registration state , it\u2019s a protection against CSRF on the client (a random string generated by the client, that it can check when the user will be redirected with the authorization code. It can be used as a key in local storage for storing a state in a SPA). response_type , only code is supported scope , a space separated list of the permissions asked (like io.cozy.files:GET for read-only access to files). GET /auth/authorize?client_id=oauth-client-1&response_type=code&scope=io.cozy.files:GET%20io.cozy.contacts&state=Eh6ahshepei5Oojo&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.org%2F HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Note we warn the user that he is about to share his data with an application which only the callback URI is guaranteed. POST /auth/authorize \u00b6 When the user accepts, her browser send a request to this endpoint: POST /auth/authorize HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded state=Eh6ahshepei5Oojo&client_id=oauth-client-1&scope=io.cozy.files:GET%20io.cozy.contacts&csrf_token=johw6Sho&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.org%2F Note : this endpoint is protected against CSRF attacks. The user is then redirected to the original client, with an access code in the URL: HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Location : https://client.org/?state=Eh6ahshepei5Oojo&code=Aih7ohth# GET /auth/authorize/sharing & POST /auth/authorize/sharing \u00b6 They are similar to /auth/authorize : they also make the user accept an OAuth thing, but it is specialized for sharing. They are a few differences, like the scope format (sharing rules, not permissions) and the redirection after the POST. POST /auth/access_token \u00b6 Now, the client can check that the state is correct, and if it is the case, ask for an access_token . It can use this route with the code given above. This endpoint is also used to refresh the access token, by sending the refresh_token instead of the code . The parameters are: grant_type , with authorization_code or refresh_token as value code or refresh_token , depending on which grant type is used client_id client_secret Example: POST /auth/access_token HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded Accept : application/json grant_type=authorization_code&code=Aih7ohth&client_id=oauth-client-1&client_secret=Oung7oi5 HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-type : application/json { \"access_token\" : \"ooch1Yei\" , \"token_type\" : \"bearer\" , \"refresh_token\" : \"ui0Ohch8\" , \"scope\" : \"io.cozy.files:GET io.cozy.contacts\" } POST /auth/secret_exchange \u00b6 This endpoint is designed to trade a secret for a client. It is useful when an OAuth client had been previously generated by an external entity with an onboarding secret. The only parameter needed is secret .

The access tokens are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) , like this: Claim Fullname What it identifies aud Audience Identify the recipient where the token can be used (like access ) iss Issuer Identify the Cozy instance (its domain in fact) iat Issued At Identify when the token was issued (Unix timestamp) sub Subject Identify the client that can use the token scope Scope Identify the scope of actions that the client can accomplish The scope is used for permissions . Other tokens can be JWT with a similar formalism, or be a simple random value (when we want to have a clear revocation process). What happens when the user has lost her passphrase? She can reset it from the command-line, like this: $ cozy-stack instances reset-passphrase cozy.example.org ek0Jah1R A new password is generated and print in the console. Is two-factor authentication (2FA) possible? Yes, it\u2019s possible. Via the cozy-settings application, the two-factor authentication can be activated. Here is how it works in more details: On each connection, when the 2FA is activated, the user is asked for its passphrase first. When entering correct passphrase, the user is then asked for: a TOTP (Timebased One-Time password, RFC 6238) derived from a secret associated with the instance. a short term timestamped MAC with the same validity time-range and also derived from the same secret. The TOTP is valid for a time range of about 5 minutes. When sending a correct and still-valid pair (passcode, token) , the user is granted with authentication cookie. The passcode can be sent to the instance\u2019s owner via email \u2014 more transport shall be added later. Client-side apps \u00b6 Important : OAuth2 is not used here! The steps looks similar (like obtaining a token), but when going in the details, it doesn\u2019t match. How to register the application? \u00b6 The application is registered at install. See app management for details. How to get a token? \u00b6 When a user access an application, she first loads the HTML page. Inside this page, a token specific to this app is injected (only for private routes), via a templating method. We have prefered our custom solution to the implicit grant type of OAuth2 for 2 reasons: It has a better User Experience. The implicit grant type works with 2 redirections (the application to the stack, and then the stack to the application), and the first one needs JS to detect if the token is present or not in the fragment hash. It has a strong impact on the time to load the application. The implicit grant type of OAuth2 has a severe drawback on security: the token appears in the URL and is shown by the browser. It can also be leaked with the HTTP Referer header. The token will be given only for the authenticated user. For nested subdomains (like calendar.joe.example.net ), the session cookie from the stack is enough (it is for .joe.example.net ). But for flat subdomains (like joe-calendar.example.net ), it\u2019s more complicated. On the first try of the user, she will be redirected to the stack. As she is already logged-in, she will be redirected to the app with a session code (else she can login). This session code can be exchanged to a session cookie. A redirection will still happen to remove the code from the URL (it helps to avoid the code being saved in the browser history). For security reasons, the session code have the following properties: It can only be used once. It is tied to an application ( calendar in our example). It has a very short time span of validity (1 minute). How to use a token? \u00b6 The token can be sent to the cozy-stack as a Bearer token in the Authorization header, like this: GET /data/io.cozy.events/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Authorization : Bearer application-token If the user is authenticated, her cookies will be sent automatically. The cookies are needed for a token to be valid. How to refresh a token? \u00b6 The token is valid only for 24 hours. If the application is opened for more than that, it will need to get a new token. But most applications won\u2019t be kept open for so long and it\u2019s okay if they don\u2019t try to refresh tokens. At worst, the user just had to reload its page and it will work again. The app can know it\u2019s time to get a new token when the stack starts sending 401 Unauthorized responses. In that case, it can fetches the same html page that it was loaded initially, parses it and extracts the new token. Third-party websites \u00b6 How to register the application? \u00b6 If a third-party websites would like to access a cozy, it had to register first. For example, a big company can have data about a user and may want to offer her a way to get her data back in her cozy. When the user is connected on the website of this company, she can give her cozy address. The website will then register on this cozy, using the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol, as explained above . How to get a token? \u00b6 To get an access token, it\u2019s enough to follow the authorization code flow of OAuth2: sending the user to the cozy, on the authorize page if the user approves, she is then redirected back to the client the client gets the access code and can exchange it to an access token. How to use a token? \u00b6 The access token can be sent as a bearer token, in the Authorization header of HTTP: GET /data/io.cozy.contacts/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Accept : application/json Authorization : Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ How to refresh a token? \u00b6 The access token will be valid only for 24 hours. After that, a new access token must be asked. To do that, just follow the refresh token flow, as explained above . Devices and browser extensions \u00b6 For devices and browser extensions, it is nearly the same than for third-party websites. The main difficulty is the redirect_uri. In OAuth2, the access code is given to the client by redirecting the user to an URL controlled by the client. But devices and browser extensions don\u2019t have an obvious URL for that. The IETF has published an RFC called OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps . Native apps on desktop \u00b6 A desktop native application can start an embedded webserver on localhost. The redirect_uri will be something like http://127.0.0.1:19856/callback . Native apps on mobile \u00b6 On mobile, the native apps can often register a custom URI scheme, like com.example.oauthclient:/ . Just be sure that no other app has registered itself with the same URI. Chrome extensions \u00b6 Chrome extensions can use URL like https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/<anything-here> for their usage. See https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_identity#non for more details. It has also a method to simplify the creation of such an URL: chrome.identity.getRedirectURL . Firefox extensions \u00b6 It is possible to use an out of band URN: urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob:auto . The token is then extracted from the title of the page. See this addon for google oauth2 as an example. Security considerations \u00b6 The master password, the password known by the user, is derived on the clients to give two keys. The first key is used to login on the stack, the second key is used to do client-side encryption. The derivation for the login password is currently done with the PBKDF2 algorithm (with SHA256), but we have anticipated the possibility of changing to another algorithm if desirable. The derived password is stored on the server in a secure fashion, with a password hashing function. The hashing function and its parameter are stored with the hash, in order to make it possible to change the algorithm and/or the parameters later if we had any suspicion that it became too weak. The initial algorithm is scrypt . The access code is valid only once, and will expire after 5 minutes Dynamically registered applications won\u2019t have access to all possible scopes. For example, an application that has been dynamically registered can\u2019t ask the cozy owner to give it the right to install other applications. This limitation should improve security, as avoiding too powerful scopes to be used with unknown applications. The cozy stack will apply rate limiting to avoid brute-force attacks. The cozy stack offers CORS for most of its services. But it\u2019s disabled for /auth (it doesn\u2019t make sense here) and for the client-side applications (to avoid leaking their tokens). The client should really use HTTPS for its redirect_uri parameter, but it\u2019s allowed to use HTTP for localhost, as in the native desktop app example. OAuth2 says that the state parameter is optional in the authorization code flow. But it is mandatory to use it with Cozy.

It is a framework, not a strictly defined protocol, for organizing the interactions between these 4 actors: the resource owner, the \u201cuser\u201d that can click on buttons the client, the website or application that would like to access the resources the authorization server, whose role is limited to give tokens but is central in OAuth2 interactions the resources server, the server that controls the resources. For cozy, both the authorization server and the resources server roles are played by the cozy-stack. The resource owner is the owner of a cozy instance. The client can be the cozy-desktop app, cozy-mobile, or many other applications. OAuth2, and its extensions, is a large world. At its core, there is 2 things: letting the client get a token issued by the authorization server, and using this token to access to the resources. OAuth2 describe 4 flows, called grant types, for the first part: Authorization code Implicit grant type Client credentials grant type Resource owner credentials grant type. On cozy, only the most typical one is used: authorization code. To start this flow, the client must have a client_id and client_secret . The Cozy stack implements the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (an extension to OAuth2) to allow the clients to obtain them. OAuth2 has also 3 ways to use a token: in the query-string (even if the spec does not recommended it) in the POST body in the HTTP Authorization header. On cozy, only the HTTP header is supported. OAuth2 has a lot of assumptions. Let\u2019s see some of them and their consequences on Cozy: TLS is very important to secure the communications. in OAuth 1, there was a mechanism to sign the requests. But it was very difficult to get it right for the developers and was abandonned in OAuth2, in favor of using TLS. The Cozy instance are already accessible only in HTTPS, so there is nothing particular to do for that. There is a principle called TOFU, Trust On First Use. It said that if the user will give his permission for delegating access to its resources when the client will try to access them for the first time. Later, the client will be able to keep accessing them even if the user is no longer here to give his permissions. The client can\u2019t make the assumptions about when its tokens will work. The tokens have no meaning for him (like cookies in a browser), they are just something it got from the authorization server and can send with its request. The access token can expire, the user can revoke them, etc. OAuth 2.0 defines no cryptographic methods. But a developer that want to use it will have to put her hands in that. If you want to learn OAuth 2 in details, I recommend the OAuth 2 in Action book .","title":"What about OAuth2?"},{"location":"cozy-stack/auth/#the-cozy-stack-as-an-authorization-server","text":"In general, the cozy stack manages the authentication itself.

Inside this page, a token specific to this app is injected (only for private routes), via a templating method. We have prefered our custom solution to the implicit grant type of OAuth2 for 2 reasons: It has a better User Experience. The implicit grant type works with 2 redirections (the application to the stack, and then the stack to the application), and the first one needs JS to detect if the token is present or not in the fragment hash. It has a strong impact on the time to load the application. The implicit grant type of OAuth2 has a severe drawback on security: the token appears in the URL and is shown by the browser. It can also be leaked with the HTTP Referer header. The token will be given only for the authenticated user. For nested subdomains (like calendar.joe.example.net ), the session cookie from the stack is enough (it is for .joe.example.net ). But for flat subdomains (like joe-calendar.example.net ), it\u2019s more complicated. On the first try of the user, she will be redirected to the stack. As she is already logged-in, she will be redirected to the app with a session code (else she can login). This session code can be exchanged to a session cookie. A redirection will still happen to remove the code from the URL (it helps to avoid the code being saved in the browser history).

The derived password is stored on the server in a secure fashion, with a password hashing function.

For example, it can be used to have /etc/cozy/cozy.yml managed by a package manager, and /etc/cozy/cozy.yml.local for things that a user can customize. Templating and Environment Variables \u00b6 It is possible to pass environnment variable to this configuration using the template language of golang , delimited by {{ and }} . The environment variables are available in the .Env variable. For instance the text {{.Env.COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE }} will be replaced by the value of the COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE environment variable. The template is evaluated at startup of the stack. Values and Example \u00b6 To see the detail of the available parameters available, you can see an example of configuration in the cozy.example.yaml file at the root of this repository. This file contains all the parameters and fields that can be used to configure the stack with some example values. Some fields can be overriden by the flags of the cozy-stack serve command . Stack endpoints \u00b6 By default, cozy-stack use plain-text & local socket for client ( localhost:8080 ) and admin ( localhost:6060 ) communications. If you want to control a remote stack or using TLS to secure communications, you can configure your cozy-stack client with the following CLI arguments or environment variables. Argument Env variable Default value Usage --host / --admin-host COZY_HOST / COZY_ADMIN_HOST localhost `[http[s]://] [: ]` --port / --admin-port COZY_PORT / COZY_ADMIN_PORT 8080 / 6060 COZY_HOST_TIMEOUT / COZY_ADMIN_TIMOUT 15s HTTP timeout to use Must be [a valid golang duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) like `10s` or `1m` COZY_HOST_VALIDATE / COZY_ADMIN_VALIDATE true Enable HTTPS certificate validation Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?validate=false` COZY_HOST_CA / COZY_ADMIN_CA none CA file to use for HTTPS certificate validation Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?ca= ` COZY_HOST_CERT / COZY_ADMIN_CERT none Client certificate to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?cert= ` COZY_HOST_KEY / COZY_ADMIN_KEY none Client certificate to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?key= ` COZY_HOST_FINGERPRINT / COZY_ADMIN_FINGERPRINT none Hex-encoded SHA-256 key pinning to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?fp= ` You can get the fingerprint of a given certificate with `openssl x509 -in -pubkey | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex` Or directly from a private key with `openssl pkey -in -pubout -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex` Administration secret \u00b6 To access to the administration API (the /admin/* routes), a secret passphrase should be stored in a cozy-admin-passphrase . This file should be in one of the configuration directories, along with the main config file. The passphrase is stored in a salted-hashed representation using scrypt. To generate this file, you can use the cozy-stack config passwd [filepath] command. This command will ask you for a passphrase and will create the cozy-admin-passphrase at the specified path. You can use the COZY_ADMIN_PASSWORD env variable if you do not want to type the passphrase each time you call cozy-stack . Example \u00b6 $ mkdir ~/.cozy && cozy-stack config passwd ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase Hashed passphrase will be writtent in ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase Passphrase: Confirmation: $ cat ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase scrypt $16384$8$1$936 bd62faf633b5f946f653c21161a9b $4 e0d11dfa5fc1676ed329938b11a6584d30e603e0d06b8a63a99e8cec392d682 Hooks \u00b6 Cozy-stack can run scripts on some events to customize it. The scripts must be in the hooks directory defined in the config, have a predefined name, and be executable. Then, they should be fired automatically. Let\u2019s the available hooks. The pre-add-instance hook is run just before creating an instance. It can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It can be used to check the domain for example. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that will be created. The post-add-instance hook is run just after an instance has been created. installed. It can be used to setup DNS for this instance for example. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that has been created. The pre-remove-instance hook is run just before destroying an instance. It can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It can be used to make a backup of the instance before destroying it. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that will be destroyed. The post-remove-instance hook is run just after an instance has been destroyed. It can be used to do some cleanup. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that has been destroyed. The pre-install-app hook is run just before installing an application, and can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application will be installed the application name that will be installed. The post-install-app hook is run just after an application has been installed. It can be used for logging, notification, statistics, etc. It\u2019s also a good place to add a vhost for an application in the reverse-proxy configuration, with a TLS certificate. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application has been installed the application name that has been installed. The pre-uninstall-app hook is run just before uninstalling an application, and can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application will be uninstalled the application name that will be uninstalled. The post-uninstall-app hook is run just after an application has been uninstalled. It can be used for cleaning the configuration of the reverse- proxy for example. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application has been uninstalled the application name that has been uninstalled. Customizing a context \u00b6 Intro \u00b6 In the config file of cozy-stack, it\u2019s possible to declare some contexts, that are a way to regroup some cozy instances to give similar configuration. For example, it is possible to give a default_redirection that will be used when the user logs into their cozy. You can find more example in the example config file. Assets \u00b6 The visual appearance of a cozy instance can be customized via some assets (CSS, JS, images). These assets can be inserted from the command-line with the cozy-stack assets add command. Here are a small list of assets that you may want to customize: /styles/theme.css : a CSS file where you can override the colors and put other CSS rules /favicon-16x16.png and /favicon-32x32.png : the two variants of the favicon /apple-touch-icon.png : the same but for Apple /images/default-avatar.png : the image to use as the default avatar. /images/default-wallpaper.png : the image to use as the default wallpapper on the home. /images/icon-cozy-home.svg : the home icon used and displayed by the cozy-bar.","title":"Configuration file"},{"location":"cozy-stack/config/#configuration","text":"","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"cozy-stack/config/#main-configuration-file","text":"You can configure your cozy-stack using a configuration file.

For false , a more heavy solution is required: a partial index . Index selection \u00b6 CouchDB may accept or refuse to use a mango index for a query, with obsure reasons. In general, you can follow these two rules of thumb: An index on the fields foo, bar, baz can be used only to fetch documents where foo , bar , and baz exist. It means that a query that filters only on the value on foo won\u2019t use the mango index, because it can miss a document where foo has the expected value but without bar or baz . If you know that all the documents that you want have the bar and baz fields, you can just add two filters $exists: true (one for bar , the other for baz ). You should use exactly the same sequence of fields for creating the index and the sort operator of the query. If you have an index on os, browser, ip for the io.cozy.sessions.logins , and you want to have all the documents for a login from windows , sorted by browser , you can use the index, but you should use os, browser, ip for the sort (or at least os, browser , even if it is seems to weird to sort on os when all the sorted documents will have the same value, windows ). Please note that using use_index on a request, the results will be sorted by default according to this rule. So, you can omit the sort operator on the query (except if you want the descending order).

Note that: All symbols sort before numbers and letters (even the \u201chigh\u201d symbols like tilde, 0x7e ) Differing sequences of letters are compared without regard to case, so a < aa but also A < aa and a < AA Identical sequences of letters are compared with regard to case, with lowercase before uppercase, so a < A . Old revisions \u00b6 CouchDB keeps for each document a list of its revision (or more exactly a tree with replication and conflicts). It\u2019s possible to ask the list of the old revisions of a document with GET /db/{docid}?revs_info=true . It works only if the document has not been deleted. For a deleted document, a trick is to query the changes feed to know the last revision of the document, and to recreate the document from this revision. With an old revision, it\u2019s possible to get the content of the document at this revision with GET /db/{docid}?rev={rev} if the database was not compacted.

It makes it hard to use pagination on it. We have added a non-standard _normal_docs endpoint. This new endpoint skip the design docs (and does not count them in the total_rows ). It accepts three parameters in the query string: limit (default: 100), skip (default: 0), and bookmark (default: \u2018\u2019). Note that the response format is a bit different, it looks more like a _find response with mango. And, like for _find , the limit cannot be more than 1000. The pagination is also the same: both bookmark and skip can be used, but bookmark is recommended for performances.

The difference is the first one uses an id to identify the file/directory to update, and the second one uses the path. Some specific attributes of the patch can be used: dir_id attribute can be updated to move a file or directory move_to_trash boolean to specify that the file needs to be moved to the trash permanent_delete boolean to specify that the files needs to be deleted (after being trashed) HTTP headers \u00b6 It\u2019s possible to send the If-Match header, with the previous revision of the file/directory (optional).

This route does not require Basic Authentification GET /files/archive/4521DC87/project-X.zip HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/zip Content-Length : 12345 Content-Disposition : attachment; filename=\"project-X.zip\" Content-Type : application/zip POST /files/downloads?Path=file_path \u00b6 Create a file download. The Path query parameter specifies the file to download. The response json API links contains a related link for downloading the file, see below. POST /files/downloads?Id=file_id \u00b6 Also create a file download. But it takes the id of the file and not its path. POST /files/downloads?VersionId=file_id/version_id \u00b6 This is a third way to create a file download. But, this time, it is for downloading an old version of a file. These 3 routes also accept a Filename=... parameter in the query-string to change the filename that will be used for the downloaded file. GET /files/downloads/:secret/:name \u00b6 Allows to download a file with a secret created from the route above. The name parameter is not used in the stack but aims to allow setting a name even for browser / downloader that do not support Content-Disposition filename.

October 2019: Authentication \u00b6 We are about to change our authentification logic. This change will be transparent for end-users. End-users don\u2019t need to change anything. Developpers that used to manually send POST /auth/login , POST /auth/passphrase_renew or POST /settings/passphrase requests will need to update their code. What are the changes \u00b6 Previously, we expected the user to type its passphrase on the browser. This passphrase was sent to the stack. There it was salted, hashed and compared to the salted-hashed version stored on our systems. From today, the browser will send an intermediary secret to the server instead of your passphrase. The rest of the process will stay unchanged. We\u2019ll salt and hash this intermediary secret ans compare it the the salted-hashed version stored on our system. The three API endpoint upper have been updated and now require you to pass this intermediary secret instead of the old passphrase. The settings endpoint will also expect a parameter with a number of pbkdf2 iterations. Dirty details for developers \u00b6 The intermediary secret is built from the user passphrase and the URL of its instance with the following formula: user - iterations = # from a / bitwarden / api / accounts / prelogin request user - salt = \"me@\" + host key = pbdkf2 ( passphrase , salt = user - salt , iterations = user - salt , alg = SHA - 256 ) secret = pbkdf2 ( key , salt = passphrase , iterations = 1 , alg = SHA - 256 ) \u2026where passphrase is the user passphrase in UTF-8 and host is the instance host string (without protocol, like \u201cexample.mycozy.cloud\u201d). The default iteration number in the first step ( user-iterations ) is a per-user settings set by the stack. You can find it by emitting a prelogin request . You can also see the user-salt and user-iterations in io.cozy.settings or through a GET /settings/passphrase request. For most of users, the today\u2019s default is 100_000 pbkdf2 iterations. Users initializing their account with a Edge browser will default to 10_000 iterations (Edge does not have a native pbkdf2 function and this is a balance between security and user experience). As always, if you have any doubt, you can explore our own source code. At the time of writing, there is a function nativeHash on password-helpers.js used on the login page of the stack. A schema of the new architecture is available in the Bitwarden section of the stack . Migration \u00b6 Users will migrate transparently to the new authentification logic on their first login.

Manifest 2. Intent Start 3. Service Resolution 4. Handshake 5. Processing & Terminating Routes Annexes Use cases Bibliography & Prior Art Discarded Ideas Overview \u00b6 A typical Cozy Cloud runs multiple applications, but most of these applications are focused on one task and interact with one particular type of data. However, Cozy Cloud especially shines when data is combined across apps to provide an integrated experience. This is made difficult by the fact that apps have no dedicated back-end and that they have restricted access to documents. This document outlines a proposal for apps to rely on each other to accomplish certain tasks and gain access to new documents, in a way that hopefully is neither painful for the users nor the developers. Glossary \u00b6 Intent : Intents, sometimes also called Activities, is a pattern used in environments where multiple apps with different purposes coexist. The idea is that any app can express the need to do something that it can\u2019t do itself, and an app that can do it will take over from there. Stack : refers to cozy-stack , the server-side part of the Cozy infrastructure. Client : the client is the application that starts an intent. Service : the service is the application that handles an intent started by a client. Available apps : Uninstalled applications that handles the intent. Proposal \u00b6 In this proposal, services declare themselves through their manifest. When a clients starts an intent, the stack finds the appropriate service and help the two apps to create a communication channel between them. After the channel is ready, the intent is processed. These steps are detailed below. 1. Manifest \u00b6 Every app can register itself as a potential handler for one or more intents. To do so, it must provide the following information for each intent it wishes to handle: action : A verb that describes what the service should do. The most common actions are CREATE , EDIT , OPEN , PICK , and SHARE . While we recommend using one of these verbs, the list is not exhaustive and may be extended by any app. type : One or more types of data on which the service knows how to operate the action . A type can be expressed as a MIME type or a Cozy Document Type . The application must have permissions for any Cozy Document Type listed here. You can also think of the type as the intent\u2019s subject. href : the relative URL of the route designed to handle this intent. A query-string with the intent id will be added to this URL. These informations must be provided in the manifest of the application, inside the intents key. Here is a very simple example: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" } ] When this service is called, it will load the page https://service.domain.example.com/pick?intent=123abc . Here is an example of an app that supports multiple data types: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" , \"image/*\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" } ] Finally, here is an example of an app that supports several intent types: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" , \"image/*\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" }, { \"action\" : \"VIEW\" , \"type\" : [ \"image/gif\" ], \"href\" : \"/viewer\" } ] This information is stored by the stack when the application is installed. 2. Intent Start \u00b6 Any app can start a new intent whenever it wants. When it does, the app becomes the client . To start an intent, it must specify the following information: action : an action verb, which will be matched against the actions declared in services manifest files. type : a single data type, which will be matched against the types declared in services manifest files. There are also two optional fields that can be defined at the start of the intent: data : Any data that the client wants to make available to the service. data must be a JSON object but its structure is left to the discretion of the client. The only exception is when type is a MIME type and the client wishes to send a file to the service. In that case, the file should be represented as a base-64 encoded Data URL and must be named content . This convention is also recomended when dealing with other intent type s. See the examples below for an example of this. permissions : When type is a Cozy Document Type and the client expects to receive one or more documents as part of the reply from the service, the permissions field allows the client to request permissions for these documents. permissions is a list of HTTP Verbs. Refer to this section of the permission documentation for more information. Note : if the intent\u2019s subject is a Cozy Doctype that holds references to other Cozy Documents (such as an album referencing photos or a playlist referencing music files), the permissions should be granted for the referenced documents too, whenever possible. Here is an example of what the API could look like: // \"Let the user pick a file\" cozy . intents . start ( 'PICK' , 'io.cozy.files' ) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the picked file }); // \"Create a contact, with some information already filled out\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.contacts' , { name : 'John Johnsons' , tel : '+12345678' email : 'john@johnsons.com' }) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the contact that was created }); // \"Save this file somewhere\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.files' , { content : 'data:application/zip;base64,UEsDB...' , name : 'photos.zip' }); // \"Create a new note, and give me read-only access to it\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.notes' , {}, [ 'GET' ]) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // \"Create an event based on the provided data, and give me full access to it\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.events' , { date : '2017/06/24' , title : 'Beach day' }, [ 'ALL' ]) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // \"Crop this picture\" cozy . intents . start ( 'EDIT' , 'image/png' , { content : 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw...' , width : 50 , height : 50 }) . then ( image => { //image is the edited version of the image provided above. }) 3. Service Resolution \u00b6 The service resolution is the phase where a service is chosen to handle an intent. This phase is handled by the stack. After the client has started it\u2019s intent, it sends the action , the type and the permissions to the stack. The stack will then traverse the list of installed apps and find all the apps that can handle that specific combination. Note that if the intent request GET permissions on a certain Cozy Document Type, but the service does not have this permission itself, it can not handle the intent. The stack then stores the information for that intent: A unique id for that intent Client URL Service URL action type permissions Finally, the service URL is suffixed with ?intent= followed by the intent\u2019s id, and then sent to the client. 4. Available apps \u00b6 In addition to the services that manage intents, a list of available (but not installed) applications of the instance that handles the intent is returned. This object list is called availableApps and contains: - The application slug - The application name Service choice \u00b6 If more than one service match the intent\u2019s criteria, the stack returns the list of all matching service URLs to the client (and stores it in the service URL version of the intent it keeps in memory). The client is then free to pick one arbitrarily. The client may also decide to let the user choose one of the services. To do this, it should start another intent with a PICK action and a io.cozy.apps type . This intent should be resolved by the stack to a special page, in order to avoid having multiple services trying to handle it and ending up in a loop. This special page is a service like any other; it expects the list of services to pick from as input data, and will return the one that has been picked to the client. The client can then proceed with the first intent. The user may decide to abort the intent before picking a service. If that is the case, the choice page will need to inform the client that the intent was aborted. No available service \u00b6 If no service is available to handle an intent, the stack returns an error to the client. However, some non-installed applications may handle the intent, and are listed in the availableApps field. 4. Handshake \u00b6 The next phase consist of the client and the service establishing a communication channel between them. The communication will be done using the window.postMessage API. Service Initialization \u00b6 When the client receives the service URL from the stack, it starts to listen for messages coming from that URL. Once the listener is started, it opens an iframe that points to the service\u2019s URL. Service to Client \u00b6 At this point, the service app is opened on the route that it provided in the href part of it\u2019s manifest. This route now also contains the intent\u2019s id. The service queries the stack to find out information about the intent, passing along the intent id. In response, the stack sends the client\u2019s URL, the action , and the type . If the intent includes permissions , the stack sends them too, as well as the client\u2019s permission id. It then starts to listen for messages coming from the client\u2019s URL. Eventually, it sends a message to the client, as a mean to inform it that the service is now ready. Client to Service \u00b6 After the client receives the \u201cready\u201d message from the service, it sends a message to the service acknowledging the \u201cready\u201d state. Along with this message, it should send the data that was provided at the start of the intent, if any. 5. Processing & Terminating \u00b6 After this handshake, there is a confirmed communication channel between the client and the service, and the service knows what it has to do. This is the phase where the user interacts with the service. If the service is going to grant extra permissions to the client app, it is strongly recommended to make this clear to the user. When the service has finished his task, it sends a \u201ccompleted\u201d message to the client. Permissions extensions should have been done before that. Along with the completed message, the service should send any data it deems relevant. This data should be a JSON object. Again, the structure of that object is left to the discretion of the service, except when type is a MIME type. In that case, the file should be represented as a base-64 encoded Data URL and must be named content . This convention is also recomended when dealing with other intent type s. After the client receives a \u201ccompleted\u201d message, it can close the service\u2019s iframe and resume operations as usual. If, for whatever reason, the service can not fulfill the intent, it can send an \u201cerror\u201d message to the client. When the client receives an \u201cerror\u201d message, the intent is aborted and the iframe can be closed. Routes \u00b6 POST /intents \u00b6 The client app can ask to start an intent via this route. Any client-side app can call this route, no permission is needed. Request \u00b6 POST /intents HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.net Authorization : Bearer eyJhbG...

Since we were unable to find a use case where a new window is required, we decided not to include the disposition in this specification. It might be added later if the need arises. Client / Server architecture \u00b6 Instead of letting the two applications communicate with each other, they could be made to talk through the stack. This would be useful as the stack could act as a middleware, transforming data on the fly or granting permissions where appropriate. However, this approach has also severe drawbacks, notably the fact that the stack must hold a copy of all the data that the apps want to transfer (which can include large files). It also makes it significantly harder for the client to know when the intent has been processed. Data representation \u00b6 The client could explicitly request a data format to be used in the communication. However, this idea was abandoned because the format is always json, except when then intent\u2019s type is a MIME type, in which case the data format also uses this type.","title":"/intents - Intents"},{"location":"cozy-stack/intents/#intents","text":"Overview Glossary Proposal 1.

Here is an example of what the API could look like: // \"Let the user pick a file\" cozy . intents . start ( 'PICK' , 'io.cozy.files' ) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the picked file }); // \"Create a contact, with some information already filled out\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.contacts' , { name : 'John Johnsons' , tel : '+12345678' email : 'john@johnsons.com' }) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the contact that was created }); // \"Save this file somewhere\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.files' , { content : 'data:application/zip;base64,UEsDB...' , name : 'photos.zip' }); // \"Create a new note, and give me read-only access to it\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.notes' , {}, [ 'GET' ]) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // \"Create an event based on the provided data, and give me full access to it\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.events' , { date : '2017/06/24' , title : 'Beach day' }, [ 'ALL' ]) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // \"Crop this picture\" cozy . intents . start ( 'EDIT' , 'image/png' , { content : 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw...' , width : 50 , height : 50 }) . then ( image => { //image is the edited version of the image provided above. })","title":"2.

These tasks can be scheduled in advance, recurring or sudden and provide various services. At the time, we do not provide \u201cgeneric\u201d and programmable tasks. This list of available workers is part of the defined API. The job queue can be either local to the cozy-stack when used as a monolithic instance (self-hosted for instance) or distributed via a redis server for distributed infrastructures. This doc introduces two cozy types: io.cozy.jobs for jobs io.cozy.triggers for triggers Triggers \u00b6 Jobs can be queued up via the /jobs/queue/:worker-type API, for a direct execution. But it can also be convenient to schedule jobs on some conditions, and the triggers are the way to do that. Jobs can be launched by five different types of triggers: @at to schedule a one-time job executed after at a specific time in the future @in to schedule a one-time job executed after a specific amount of time @every to schedule periodic jobs executed at a given fix interval @cron to schedule recurring jobs scheduled at specific times @event to launch a job after a change on documents in the cozy. These five triggers have specific syntaxes to describe when jobs should be scheduled. See below for more informations. @at syntax \u00b6 The @at trigger takes a ISO-8601 formatted string indicating a UTC time in the future. The date is of this form: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ Examples @at 2018-12-12T15:36:25.507Z @in syntax \u00b6 The @in trigger takes the same duration syntax as @every Examples @in 10m @in 1h30m @every syntax \u00b6 The @every trigger uses the same syntax as golang\u2019s time.ParseDuration (but only support time units above seconds): A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as \u201c300ms\u201d, \u201c1.5h\u201d or \u201c2h45m\u201d. Valid time units are \u201cs\u201d, \u201cm\u201d, \u201ch\u201d. Examples @every 1.5h # schedules every 1 and a half hours @every 30m10s # schedules every 30 minutes and 10 seconds @cron syntax \u00b6 In order to schedule recurring jobs, the @cron trigger has the syntax using six fields: Field name Mandatory? Allowed values Allowed special characters Seconds Yes 0-59 * / , - Minutes Yes 0-59 * / , - Hours Yes 0-23 * / , - Day of month Yes 1-31 * / , - ? Month Yes 1-12 or JAN-DEC * / , - Day of week Yes 0-6 or SUN-SAT * / , - ? Asterisk ( * ) The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month. Slash ( / ) Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form \"*\\/...\" is equivalent to the form \"first-last/...\" , that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field. The form \"N-/...\" is accepted as meaning \"N-MAX/...\" , that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not wrap around. Comma ( , ) Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using \"MON,WED,FRI\" in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Hyphen ( - ) Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive. Question mark ( ? ) Question mark may be used instead of * for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank. To schedule jobs given an interval: Examples: @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 * * # Run once a month, midnight, first of month @cron 0 0 0 * * 0 # Run once a week, midnight on Sunday @cron 0 0 0 * * * # Run once a day, midnight @cron 0 0 * * * * # Run once an hour, beginning of hour @event syntax \u00b6 The @event syntax allows to trigger a job when something occurs in the stack. It follows the same syntax than permissions scope string: type[:verb][:values][:selector] Unlike for permissions string, the verb should be one of CREATED , DELETED , UPDATED . It is possible to put several verbs, separated by a comma. There is also a special value != . It means that a job will be trigger only if the value for the given selector has changed (ie the value before the update and the value after that are different). The job worker will receive a compound message including original trigger_infos messages and the event which has triggered it. Examples: @event io.cozy.files // anything happens on files @event io.cozy.files:CREATED // a file was created @event io.cozy.files:DELETED:image/jpg:mime // an image was deleted @event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED io.cozy.bank.bills:CREATED // a bank operation or a bill @event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED,UPDATED // a bank operation created or updated @event io.cozy.bank.operations:UPDATED:!=:category // a change of category for a bank operation Error Handling \u00b6 Jobs can fail to execute their task. We have two ways to parameterize such cases. Retry \u00b6 A retry count can be optionally specified to ask the worker to re-execute the task if it has failed. Each retry is executed after a configurable delay. The try count is part of the attributes of the job. Also, each occurring error is kept in the errors field containing all the errors that may have happened. Timeout \u00b6 A worker may never end. To prevent this, a configurable timeout value is specified with the job. If a job does not end after the specified amount of time, it will be aborted. A timeout is just like another error from the worker and can provoke a retry if specified. Defaults \u00b6 By default, jobs are parameterized with a maximum of 3 tries with 1 minute timeout. These defaults may vary given the workload of the workers. Jobs API \u00b6 Example and description of the attributes of a io.cozy.jobs : { \"domain\" : \"me.cozy.tools\" , \"worker\" : \"sendmail\" , // worker type name \"options\" : { \"priority\" : 3 , // priority from 1 to 100, higher number is higher priority \"timeout\" : 60 , // timeout value in seconds \"max_exec_count\" : 3 , // maximum number of time the job should be executed (including retries) }, \"arguments\" : { // the arguments will be given to the worker (if you look in CouchDB, it is called message there) \"mode\" : \"noreply\" , \"template_name\" : \"new_registration\" , \"template_values\" : { \"DevicesLink\" : \"http://me.cozy.tools/#/connectedDevices\" , } }, \"state\" : \"running\" , // queued, running, errored \"queued_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , // time of the queuing \"started_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , // time of first execution \"error\" : \"\" // error message if any } Example and description of a job creation options \u2014 as you can see, the options are replicated in the io.cozy.jobs attributes: { \"priority\" : 3 , // priority from 1 to 100 \"timeout\" : 60 , // timeout value in seconds \"max_exec_count\" : 3 , // maximum number of retry } GET /jobs/:job-id \u00b6 Get a job informations given its ID.

See triggers\u2019 descriptions to see the types of trigger and their arguments syntax. This route requires a specific permission on the worker type. A global permission on the global io.cozy.triggers doctype is not allowed. The debounce parameter can be used to limit the number of jobs created in a burst. It delays the creation of the job on the first input by the given time argument, and if the trigger has its condition matched again during this period, it won\u2019t create another job. It can be useful to combine it with the changes feed of couchdb with a last sequence number persisted by the worker, as it allows to have a nice diff between two executions of the worker. Its syntax is the one understood by go\u2019s time.ParseDuration .

When used on a specific worker, the permission can be specified on the worker field. Worker pool \u00b6 The consuming side of the job queue is handled by a worker pool. On a monolithic cozy-stack, the worker pool has a configurable fixed size of workers. The default value is not yet determined. Each time a worker has finished a job, it check the queue and based on the priority and the queued date of the job, picks a new job to execute. Permissions \u00b6 In order to prevent jobs from leaking informations between applications, we may need to add filtering per applications: for instance one queue per applications. We should also have an explicit check on the permissions of the applications before launching a job scheduled by an application. For more information, refer to our permission document . Multi-stack \u00b6 When some instances are served by several stacks, the scheduling and running of jobs can be distributed on the stacks. The synchronization is done via redis. For scheduling, there is one important key in redis: triggers . It\u2019s a sorted set. The members are the identifiants of the triggers (with the domain name), and the score are the timestamp of the next time the trigger should occur. During the short period of time where a trigger is processed, its key is moved to scheduling (another sorted set). So, even if a stack crash during processing a trigger, this trigger won\u2019t be lost. For @event triggers, we don\u2019t use the same mechanism. Each stack has all the triggers in memory and is responsible to trigger them for the events generated by the HTTP requests of their API. They also publish them on redis: this pub/sub is used for the realtime API.","title":"/jobs - Jobs"},{"location":"cozy-stack/jobs/#jobs","text":"Jobs are designed to represent asynchronous tasks that your cozy can execute.

Month Yes 1-12 or JAN-DEC * / , - Day of week Yes 0-6 or SUN-SAT * / , - ? Asterisk ( * ) The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month. Slash ( / ) Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form \"*\\/...\" is equivalent to the form \"first-last/...\" , that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field. The form \"N-/...\" is accepted as meaning \"N-MAX/...\" , that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not wrap around. Comma ( , ) Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using \"MON,WED,FRI\" in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Hyphen ( - ) Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive. Question mark ( ? ) Question mark may be used instead of * for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank. To schedule jobs given an interval: Examples: @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 * * # Run once a month, midnight, first of month @cron 0 0 0 * * 0 # Run once a week, midnight on Sunday @cron 0 0 0 * * * # Run once a day, midnight @cron 0 0 * * * * # Run once an hour, beginning of hour","title":"@cron syntax"},{"location":"cozy-stack/jobs/#event-syntax","text":"The @event syntax allows to trigger a job when something occurs in the stack.

Decryption \u00b6 The decryption of the credentials is reserved to requests coming from konnectors and services. For services, it is only available on /data/io.cozy.acconts/:account-id with an additional include=credentials parameter. Aggregator accounts \u00b6 Some konnectors are based on an aggregator service. An aggregator is declared in the konnector manifest and specify an accountId property. When Cozy-Home detects this property, it checks if an account with this given id exists. If not, it creates it. Every account created for a konnector based on an aggregator is then related to this aggregator account. This relationship is called parent account. { \"auth\" : { \"login\" : \"000000000\" , \"password\" : \"**********\" }, \"folderPath\" : \"/Administratif/Bankbank\" , \"label\" : \"Bankbank\" , \"namePath\" : \"Bankbank\" , \"relationships\" : { \"parent\" : { \"data\" : { \"_id\" : \"service-aggregator-account\" , \"_type\" : \"io.cozy.accounts\" } } } } Note: you can read more about the accounts doctype here . Konnectors \u00b6 io.cozy.konnectors are installed similarly to io.cozy.apps (see doc ) Permissions \u00b6 Like client-side applications, each konnector has an associated io.cozy.permissions . These permissions are those listed on the manifest of the konnectors, and the stack will add a permission for the files on the folder choosen by the user. Triggers \u00b6 io.cozy.triggers are used to define when konnectors are launched. See https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/jobs/#post-jobstriggers Complete flow example \u00b6 As a user, from the expenses management app, I have a clean flow to configure a connector to retrieve my travel expenses 1 - User is in my-expenses and clicks on [configure travels] 2 - my-expenses triggers an intent cozy . intents . start ( \"CREATE\" , \"io.cozy.konnectors\" , { category : \"transport\" }); 3 - the Store app catch the intent, fetch all available konnectors and let the user choose GET /registry?... HTTP / 1.1 4 - the user chooses the trainline konnector. Its manifest looks like this: { \"name\" : \"Trainline\" , \"type\" : \"konnector\" , \"slug\" : \"konnector-trainline\" , \"description\" : \"Konnector for trainline . com\" , \"source\" : \"https://github.com/konnectors/trainlines.git@build\" , \"developer\" : { \"name\" : \"XXX\" , \"url\" : \"https://www.xxx.fr\" }, \"version\" : \"3.0.0\" , \"licence\" : \"AGPL-3.0\" , \"fields\" : { \"login\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, \"password\" : { \"type\" : \"password\" }, \"advancedFields\" : { \"folderPath\" : { \"advanced\" : true , \"isRequired\" : false } } }, \"category\" : \"transport\" , \"frequency\" : \"weekly\" , \"permissions\" : { \"events\" : { \"description\" : \"Connect train bill with event in your calendar\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.events\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"PATCH\" ] } } } 5 - the user clicks on install, and the install starts: POST /konnectors/trainline HTTP / 1.1 6 - the Store then uses an intent to know which app can configure this konnector: cozy . intents . start ( \"REDIRECT\" , \"io.cozy.accounts\" , { slug : \"trainline\" }); 7 - the Store redirects to the Home. The Home asks the user for account config and create a folder to save the PDFs. 8 - the Home also add a Reference from the konnector to the folder to prevent any accidental folder deletion: POST /files/123-selected-folder-id-123/relationships/referenced_by { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.konnectors\" , \"id\" : \"io.cozy.konnectors/trainlines\" } ] } 9 - then the Home can create the account: POST /data/io.cozy.accounts HTTP / 1.1 { \"account_type\" : \"trainline\" , \"auth\" : { \"login\" : \"xxxx\" , \"password\" : \"yyyyy\" }, \"folderPath\" : \"/Administrative/Trainline\" } HTTP / 1.1 200 OK { \"_id\" : \"123-account-id-123\" , \"_rev\" : \"1-asasasasa\" , \"account_type\" : \"trainline\" , \"auth\" : { \"login\" : \"xxxx\" , }, \"folderPath\" : \"/Administrative/Trainline\" } 10 - the Home create the trigger: POST /jobs/io.cozy.triggers { \"data\" : { \"attributes\" : { \"type\" : \"@cron\" , \"arguments\" : \"0 0 0 0 1 1 \" , \"worker\" : \"konnector\" , \"message\" : { \"konnector\" : \"trainline\" , \"account\" : \"5165621628784562148955\" , \"folder_to_save\" : \"877854878455\" } } } } 11 - and, finally, the Home runs the konnector for the first time: POST /jobs/triggers/abc159753/launch HTTP / 1.1 12 - the Home uses the realtime to be informed if the konnector fails to login or succeeds to import the PDFs. If the user wants to use several account, the Home can setup several triggers for the same konnector & various accounts. Konnector Worker specs \u00b6 Prepare the execution \u00b6 The cozy-stack prepares the execution of the konnector by doing these steps: it checks that the konnector is not in maintenance in the registry (except for manual execution) it ensures that the konnector has a folder where it can write its files, and has the permission to write in this folder. Execute the konnector \u00b6 Start the konnector through nsjail, passing as ENV variables: - `COZY_URL`: the starting instance URL - `COZY_CREDENTIALS`: security token to communicate with Cozy - `COZY_FIELDS`: JSON-encoded message with the arguments from the trigger - `COZY_PARAMETERS`: JSON-encoded parameters from the konnector manifest - `COZY_LANGUAGE`: the language field of the konnector (eg. \"node\" etc.) - `COZY_LOCALE`: the locale of the user (eg. \"en\" etc.) - `COZY_TIME_LIMIT`: how much time the konnector can run before being killed - `COZY_JOB_ID`: id of the job - `COZY_JOB_MANUAL_EXECUTION`: whether the job was started manually (in Home) or automatically (via a cron trigger or event) The konnector process can send events trough its stdout (newline separated JSON object), the konnector worker pass these events to the realtime hub as io.cozy.jobs.events . Only JSON formatted events are forwarded to the client-side through realtime Otherwise formatted lines (such as node Error) will be kept in some system logs. Konnectors should NOT log the received account login values in production. Konnector error handling \u00b6 The konnector can output json formated messages as stated before (the events) and those events will be typed and formatted like this: { type : \"messagetype\" , // can be \"debug\", \"info\", \"warning\", \"error\", and \"critical\" message : \"message\" // can be any string } If there is an error or critical message, the execution will be seen as a failure by cozy-stack. It\u2019s also the case if the konnector reaches the timeout or returns with a non-zero status code. Note: debug and info level are not transmitted to syslog, except if the instance is in debug mode. It would be too verbose to do otherwise. Account deleted \u00b6 When an account is deleted, or a konnector is going to be uninstalled, the konnector is executed with the account_deleted field to true, so it can clean the account remotely. OAuth (and service secrets) \u00b6 Doctypes \u00b6 io.cozy.konnectors gives their desiderata for an account { \"fields\" : { \"account\" : { \"doctype\" : \"io.cozy.accounts\" , \"account_type\" : \"maif\" , \"scope\" : \"openid profile offline_access\" } } } io.cozy.accounts contains authentication information for an account, as well as the associated scope { \"name\" : \"Mon Compte Maif\" , \"account_type\" : \"maif\" , \"status\" : \"connected\" , \"oauth\" : { \"access_token\" : \"akosaksoakso\" , \"refresh_token\" : \"okoakozkaozk\" , \"scope\" : \"openid profile offline_access\" } } io.cozy.account_types contains the oauth configuration: { \"_id\" : \"service.example\" , \"grant_mode\" : \"authorization_code\" , \"client_id\" : \"the registered client id\" , \"client_secret\" : \"client_secret is necessary for server-flow\" , \"auth_endpoint\" : \"https://service.example/auth\" , \"token_endpoint\" : \"https://api.service.example/token\" } io.cozy.account_types are not accessible to the applications: they are injected directly in CouchDB in a global database secrets/io-cozy-account_types . Secrets that are not OAuth \u00b6 The io.cozy.account_types doctype can also be used for storing secrets that are not related to OAuth. The document still need to be injected manually in secrets/io-cozy-account_types : { \"_id\": \"service.example\", \"grant_mode\": \"secret\", \"slug\": \"service\", \"secret\": \"th1$_1$_th3_s3cr3t!\" } Note : grant_mode must be secret , slug must be the slug of the konnector, but secret can be a map instead of a simple string if several secrets are needed for this service. The secret is given to the konnector in the COZY_PARAMETERS env variable. Reminder OAuth flow \u00b6 Service is the website from which konnector aims to retrieve informations. Stack is the cozy stack. OAuth is divided in 3 steps: Client Registration: the client application (the Stack) needs to be registered with the Service Obtaining & Refreshing Authorization: all the steps from client_id to access_token , the Stack will handle those Using the access_token : ideally, the konnector should only concern itself with this part; it receives an access_token and uses it. Client Registration \u00b6 Before beginning the Grant process, most Services require the application to be registered with a defined redirect_uri . There are a lot of options, which we will choose from when actually implementing konnectors using them. Manually \u00b6 Most services requires a human developer to create the client manually and define its redirect_uri. However each instance has its own domain, so for these services, we will need to: A. Register a \u201cproxy\u201d client , which is a static page performing redirections as needed, as was done for Facebook events in v2 konnectors. We will register a well known cozy domain, like oauth-proxy.cozy.io and registers it with all providers. The use and risks associated with this domain should be made clear to the user. B. Register each Stack with a redirect_uri on the main stack domain, if we go this way, the register_uri below moves from bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/redirect to oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/redirect and the domain will be prepended to the state. This is feasible at cozy scale, but requires more knowledge and work for self-hosters. Example: Google \u00b6 For example, these are the steps for creating the google account_type for the stack at .mycozy.cloud: Go to https://console.developers.google.com Select or Create Project (up left near the logo) Enable desired APIs (TBD with usages) Click \u201cCredentials\u201d Create credentials > Oauth Client ID > Web application Set redirectURI to https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/google/redirect Copy and paste provided Client ID and Client Secret. Then save the data in the console http PUT localhost:5984/secrets%2Fio-cozy-account_types/google grant_mode=authorization_code redirect_uri=\"https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/google/redirect\" token_mode=basic token_endpoint=\"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token\" auth_endpoint=\"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth\" client_id=$CLIENT_ID client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET Dynamic Registration Protocol \u00b6 A few services allows client to register programatically through the Dynamic Client Registration Protocol RFC7591 , we should allow the Stack to register using this protocol when we first need to implement a Konnector connecting to such a Service. No redirect_url enforcement \u00b6 A few services allows to specify arbitrary redirect_url without registering beforehand as a client. Authorization Grant flows \u00b6 webserver flow (Authorization Code Grant) \u00b6 A. In the cozy app (Home) give a link < a href = \"https://bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/start? scope=photos& state=1234zyx\" > NOTE the scope may depends on other fields being configured (checkboxes), this will be described in json in the konnectors manifest. The format will be determined upon implementation. NOTE To limit bandwidth and risk of state corruption, the cozy app should save its state under a random key into localStorage, the key is then passed as the state in this query. B. Service lets the user login, allows or denies the scope, then redirects to https://oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/redirect? code=AUTH_CODE_HERE& state=1234zyx C.

SPA flow (Implicit grant) \u00b6 A. The cozy app gives a link: < a href = \"https://service.example/auth?

Service lets the user login, allows or denies the scope, then redirects to https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/? access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN& state=1234zyx C. The Cozy app adds the token to the io.cozy.accounts and save it before starting konnector. Accessing data \u00b6 Once we have an account, the Cozy app starts the konnector with the proper account id. The konnector can then fetch the account and use its access_token to performs a request to fetch data: POST https://api.service.com/resource HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN Refreshing token \u00b6 When using the server-flow, we also get a refresh_token. It is used to get a new access_token when it expires. However, if konnectors are responsible for refreshing token there is a race condition risk: (konnector A) GET https://api.service.com/resource TOKEN1 -> expired (konnector B) GET https://api.service.com/resource TOKEN1 -> expired (konnector A) POST https://api.service.com/token REFRESH_TOKEN -> TOKEN2a (konnector B) POST https://api.service.com/token REFRESH_TOKEN -> TOKEN2b (konnector A) GET https://api.service.com/token TOKEN2a -> invalid To avoid this, the stack will be responsible to perform token refresh. A konnector can requires the stack to refresh an account token with an HTTP request. POST https://bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/:accountID/refresh HTTP / 1.1 Konnectors Marketplace Requirements \u00b6 The following is a few points to be careful for in konnectors when we start allowing non-cozy developped OAuth konnectors. With SPA flow, because of advanced security concerns (confused deputy problem), cozy should validate the access_token . However, the way to do that depends on the provider and cannot be described in json, it is therefore the responsibility of the konnector itself. Account types security rules \u00b6 With server flow, an evil account type with proper auth_endpoint but bad token_endpoint could retrieve a valid token as well as cozy client secret. The reviewer of an account_type should make sure both these endpoints are on domains belonging to the Service provider. Notes for MesInfos experiment \u00b6 MAIF konnector uses the webserver flow without redirect_uri validation Orange konnector uses the client-side proxy but hosted on their own servers (/!\\ redirect_uri vs redirect_url)","title":"Workflow of the konnectors"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#konnectors-workflow","text":"","title":"Konnectors workflow"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#tldr","text":"","title":"TL;DR"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#types","text":"","title":"Types"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#accounts","text":"io.cozy.accounts contains information for an account, including those for authentication (technically, they are encrypted by cozy-stack before being saved in CouchDB, but we will show them as the konnectors will see them): { \"auth\" : { \"login\" : \"000000000\" , \"password\" : \"**********\" }, \"folderPath\" : \"/Administratif/Free Mobile\" , \"label\" : \"freemobile\" , \"namePath\" : \"Free Mobile\" } Accounts are manipulated through the /data/ API.","title":"Accounts"},{"location":"cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#decryption","text":"The decryption of the credentials is reserved to requests coming from konnectors and services.

Sharing with other users \u00b6 The owner of a cozy instance can share some documents and files with other users. It can be done in two ways: If the other user also has a cozy, it can be a cozy-to-cozy sharing. Else, the owner can give to him a link with a code or a shortcode. What is a permission? \u00b6 A permission gives the right for a request having it to do something on the stack. It is defined by four components. Type \u00b6 type is the attribute used in JSON-API or the doctype for the Data System. It is the only mandatory component. If just the type is specified, it gives access to all the operations on this type . For example, a permission on type io.cozy.contacts gives the right to create, read, update and delete any contact, and to fetch all the contacts. A permission on type io.cozy.files allow to access and modify any file or directory. Some known types: io.cozy.files , for files and folder in the VFS io.cozy.apps , for apps io.cozy.settings , for the settings io.cozy.jobs and io.cozy.triggers , for jobs io.cozy.oauth.clients , to list and revoke OAuth 2 clients It is also possible to use a wildcard to use a doctype and its sub-doctypes. For example, io.cozy.bank.* will give access to io.cozy.bank , io.cozy.bank.accounts , io.cozy.bank.accounts.stats , io.cozy.bank.settings , etc. Verbs \u00b6 It says which HTTP verbs can be used for requests to the cozy-stack. GET will give read-only access, DELETE can be used for deletions, etc. Verbs should be declared in a list, like [\"GET\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\"] , and use [\"ALL\"] as a shortcut for [\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"PATCH\", \"DELETE\"] (it is the default). Note : HEAD is implicitely implied when GET is allowed. OPTIONS for Cross-Origin Resources Sharing is always allowed, the stack does not have the informations about the permission when it answers the request. Values \u00b6 It\u2019s possible to restrict the permissions to only some documents of a doctype, or to just some files and folders. You can give a list of ids in values . Note : a permission for a folder also gives permissions with same verbs for files and folders inside it. Selector \u00b6 By default, the values are checked with the id . But it\u2019s possible to use a selector to filter on another field . In particular, it can be used for sharing. A user may share a calendar and all the events inside it. It will be done with two permissions. The first one is for the calendar: { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.calendars\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"values\" : [ \"1355812c-d41e-11e6-8467-53be4648e3ad\" ] } And the other is for the events inside the calendar: { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.events\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"selector\" : \"calendar-id\" , \"values\" : [ \"1355812c-d41e-11e6-8467-53be4648e3ad\" ] } What format for a permission? \u00b6 JSON \u00b6 The prefered format for permissions is JSON. Each permission is a map with the type , verbs , values and selector see above, plus a description that can be used to give more informations to the user. Only the type field is mandatory. In the manifest, the permissions are regrouped in a map. The key is not very relevant, it\u2019s just here for localization. The same key is used in the locales field to identify the permission. Example: { \"permissions\" : { \"contacts\" : { \"description\" : \"Required for autocompletion on @name\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.contacts\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ] }, \"images\" : { \"description\" : \"Required for the background\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.files\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" ], \"values\" : [ \"io.cozy.files.music-dir\" ] }, \"mail\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to send a congratulations email to your friends\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"sendmail\" ] } } } Inline \u00b6 OAuth2 as a scope parameter for defining the permissions given to the application. But it\u2019s only a string, not a JSON. In that case, we use a space delimited list of permissions, each permission is written compactly with : between the components. Example: io.cozy.contacts io.cozy.files:GET:io.cozy.files.music-dir io.cozy.jobs:POST:sendmail:worker Note : the verbs component can\u2019t be omitted when the values and selector are used.

First, you can add a plugin called pouchdb-debug and enable extra logs with PouchDB.debug.enable( \"pouchdb:find\" ); . This will add explanation about the queries you run in the console and it\u2019s very helpful to understand what\u2019s going on under the hood.

Long story short: anything done in memory has significant performance impacts, especially as the number of items gets larger. A more detailed guide can be found here . About indexes \u00b6 Creating an index takes some time, but the first query will also take time \u2014 you are encouraged to warm up the indexes by firing a query that uses it before it is actually needed. An exemple implementation can be found here . If there is a change in the underlying documents, the index will be partially recalculated on the next query.

Indexing more than one field \u00b6 Creating an index on several fields is not the same as creating multiple indexes on one field each. The effects of a single index on multiple fields is illustrated in the official docs and is important to understand. Furthermore, the order in which fields are indexed on a multi-index is significant, most notably when it comes to sorting. If you declare an index on the fields ['name', 'age'] , you should also sort them by ['name', 'age'] . Sorting them in a different order or using other fields will likely be done in memory and kill your performance.

Of course, sometimes a link between data and files can be useful. For example, the application can have an album with photos. The album will be a document in CouchDB (with a title and other fields), but il will also list the files to use as photos. A direct way to do that is storing the files IDs in the album document. It\u2019s simple and will work pretty well if the files are manipulated only from this application. But, files are often accessed from other apps, like cozy-desktop and cozy-drive. To improve the User eXperience, it should be nice to alert the user when a file in an album is modified or deleted. When a file is modified, we can offer the user the choice between keeping the original version in the album, or using the new modified file. When a file is moved to the trash, we can alert the user and let him/her restore the file.

The applications metadata are stored and versioned. It can be used by a cozy to list applications to be installed, and for auto-updating the applications. We define the applications registry as an API. This should allow us to defer the real implementation of the registry storage and allow different store implementations. The stack itself implement the querying part of the registry API , proxying the request to the registries attached to the instance . Publishing on our official registries \u00b6 In order for you to publish on our official registries, please follow this howto describing how to obtain a token and parameter you repository to automatically publish versions. Channels \u00b6 We differentiate three channels of release for each application: stable: for stable releases beta: for application that can be tested in advance dev: for the latest releases directly from the trunk of the repository For each of these channels, the version string has a different format which differentiate the version channel: stable: X.Y.Z where X , Y and Z are positive or null integers. beta: X.Y.Z-beta.M where X , Y , Z and M are positive or null integers dev: X.Y.Z-dev.checksum where X , Y and Z are positive or null integers and checksum is a unique identifier of the dev release (typically a shasum of the git commit) Version order \u00b6 TLDR: 1.0.0-dev._ < 1.0.0 and 1.0.0-beta._ < 1.0.0 , make sure you upgrade your app version after publishing stable. The order used to determine the latest version of a channel is the following: - `1.0.0-dev.* < 1.0.0 (dev < stable)` - `1.0.0-beta.* < 1.0.0 (beta < stable)` - `1.0.0-beta.1 < 1.0.0-beta.2` To order beta and dev releases, we apply a sort by their creation date. Objects \u00b6 Two types of objects are managed in the registry: applications and versions. Application \u00b6 An application described a specific package. It is linked to multiple versions (releases) of the application. An application object is mutable . An application object contains the following fields: slug : the application slug (unique) type : the application type (\u201cwebapp\u201d or \u201ckonnector\u201d) editor : the application editor name versions : an object containing all the channels versions latest_version : the latest available version maintenance_activated : boolean, true when the maintenance mode is activated on the application maintenance_options : present only if maintenance_activated is true, object with the following fields: flag_infra_maintenance : bool, true iff the maintenance is internal to the cozy infrastructure flag_short_maintenance : bool, true iff the maintenance is a short maintenance, waiting for a correction on our side flag_disallow_manual_exec : bool, true iff the maintenance will disallow the execution on the application, even when manually executed messages : a list of localized messages containing a short and long information messages explaining the maintenance state label : integer for a confidence grade from 0 to 5 (A to F), labelling the application from a user privacy standpoint. It is calculated from the data_usage_commitment and data_usage_commitment_by fields. data_usage_commitment : specify a technical commitment from the application editor: user_ciphered : technical commitment that the user\u2019s data is encrypted and can only be known by him. user_reserved : commitment that the data is only used for the user, to directly offer its service. none : no commitment data_usage_commitment_by : specify what entity is taking the commitment: cozy : the commitment is taken by cozy editor : the commitment is taken by the application\u2019s editor none : no commitment is taken Example: { \"slug\" : \"drive\" , \"type\" : \"webapp\" , \"editor\" : \"cozy\" , \"versions\" : { \"stable\" : [ \"3.1.1\" ], \"beta\" : [ \"3.1.1-beta.1\" ], \"dev\" : [ \"3.1.1-dev.7a8354f74b50d7beead7719252a18ed45f55d070\" ] }, \"latest_version\" : { /* */ } } Version \u00b6 A version object describe a specific release of an application. A version object is immutable . An application version object contains the following fields: slug : the application slug type : the application type (webapp, konnector, \u2026) manifest : the entire manifest defined in the package created_at : date of the release creation url : URL of the tarball containing the application at specified version size : the size of the application package (uncompressed) in bytes as string sha256 : the sha256 checksum of the application content tar_prefix : optional tar prefix directory specified to properly extract the application content The version string should follow the channels rule. Example: { \"slug\" : \"drive\" , \"type\" : \"webapp\" , \"version\" : \"3.1.2\" , \"created_at\" : \"2017-07-05T07:54:40.982Z\" , \"url\" : \"http://.../3.1.2\" , \"size\" : \"1000\" , \"sha256\" : \"466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f\" , \"manifest\" : { /* ... */ }, \"maintenance_activated\" : true , \"maintenance_options\" : { \"flag_infra_maintenance\" : true , \"flag_short_maintenance\" : false , \"flag_disallow_manual_exec\" : true , \"messages\" : { \"en\" : { \"long_message\" : \"The app is currently in maintenance because of ....\" , \"short_message\" : \"The app is currently in maintenance\" }, \"fr\" : { \"long_message\" : \"L'application est en cours de maintenance \u00e0 cause de ...\" , \"short_message\" : \"L'application est en cours de maintenance\" } } } } APIs: Adding to registry \u00b6 These APIs can be used to add elements to the registry. POST /registry/:app \u00b6 This route adds or modify an application to the registry. The content of the request should be a json object of an application. Status codes \u00b6 201 Created, when the application has been successfully added 409 Conflict, when an application with the same slug already exists 400 Bad request, if the given application data is malformed (bad slug, missing editor, \u2026) Request \u00b6 POST /registry/drive HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Token AbCdE { \"slug\" : \"drive\" , \"editor\" : \"cozy\" , \"name\" : { \"en\" : \"Drive\" , \"fr\" : \"Drive\" }, \"description\" : { \"en\" : \"The drive application\" }, \"repository\" : \"https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive\" , \"tags\" : [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" , \"baz\" ] } POST /registry/:app/:version or POST /registry/:app/versions \u00b6 This route adds a version of an application to the registry to the specified channel (stable, beta or dev). The content of the manifest file extracted from the application data is used to fill the fields of the version. Before adding the application version to the registry, the registry should check the following: the manifest file contained in the tarball should be checked and have its fields checked against the application properties the application content should check the sha256 checksum Fields of the object sent to this request: url : the url where the application tarball is stored sha256 : the sha256 checksum of the tarball version : the version value (should match the one in the manifest) parameters? : an optional json value (any) that will override the parameters field of the manifest icon? : an optional path to override the icon field of the manifest screenshots? : and optional array of path to override the screenshots field of the manifest Status codes \u00b6 201 Created, when the version has been successfully added to the registry 409 Conflict, when the version already exists 404 Not Found, when the application does not exist 412 Precondition Failed, when the sent application data is invalid (could not fetch data URL, bad checksum, bad manifest in the tarball\u2026) 400 Bad request, when the request is invalid (bad checksum encoding, bad URL\u2026) Request \u00b6 Request to add a stable release: POST /registry/drive/3.1.2 HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Token AbCdE { \"version\" : \"3.1.2\" , \"url\" : \"https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive/archive/v3.1.2.tar.gz\" , \"sha256\" : \"466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f\" } Request to add a development release: POST /registry/drive/3.1.2-dev.7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Token AbCdE { \"version\" : \"3.1.2-dev.7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a\" , \"url\" : \"https://github.com/cozy/cozy-photos-v3/archive/7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a.zip\" , \"sha256\" : \"466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f\" } Request to add a version with optional parameters: POST /registry/drive/3.1.2 HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Token AbCdE { \"version\" : \"3.1.2\" , \"url\" : \"https://github.com/cozy/cozy-photos-v3/archive/7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a.zip\" , \"sha256\" : \"466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f\" , \"parameters\" : { \"foo\" : \"bar\" , \"baz\" : 123 } } Response \u00b6 HTTP / 1.1 201 Created Content-Type : application/json Location : http://.../3.1.2 { \"slug\" : \"drive\" , \"type\" : \"webapp\" , \"version\" : \"3.1.2-dev.7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a\" , \"created_at\" : \"2017-07-05T07:54:40.982Z\" , \"url\" : \"http://.../7a1618dff78ba445650f266bbe334cbc9176f03a.zip\" , \"size\" : \"1000\" , \"sha256\" : \"466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f\" , \"manifest\" : { /* ... */ } } APIs: Querying registry \u00b6 These routes define the querying part of a registry to access to the available applications and versions. These APIs are also implemented directly by the cozy-stack. GET /registry \u00b6 Get the list of all applications. A pagination scheme is available via the limit and cursor query parameter. The filter[???] query parameters can be used to filter by fields values. Filtering is allowed on the following fields: type editor category tags Filtering is allowed on multiple tags with the , separator. For example: filter[tags]=foo,bar will match the applications with both foo and bar as tags. Sorting is allowed on the following fields: slug type editor category created_at updated_at Query-String \u00b6 Parameter Description cursor the cursor of the last application on the previous page limit the maximum number of applications to show filter[] a filter to apply on fields of the application sort name of the field on which to apply the sort of the list versionsChannel the channels from which we list the version numbers latestChannelVersion the channel from which we select the latest version Request \u00b6 GET /registry?filter[category]=main&limit=20&sort=slug&versionsChannel=dev&latestChannelVersion=beta HTTP / 1.1 Response \u00b6 HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type : application/json { \"data\" : [ { \"slug\" : \"drive\" , \"type\" : \"webapp\" , \"editor\" : \"cozy\" , \"versions\" : { \"stable\" : [ \"3.1.1\" ], \"beta\" : [ \"3.1.1-beta.1\" ], \"dev\" : [ \"3.1.1-dev.7a8354f74b50d7beead7719252a18ed45f55d070\" ] }, \"latest_version\" : { \"slug\" : \"drive\" , \"type\" : \"webapp\" , \"version\" : \"3.1.1-beta.1\" , \"url\" : \"http://.../3.1.1-beta.1\" , \"sha256\" : \"466aa0815926fdbf33fda523af2b9bf34520906ffbb9bf512ddf20df2992a46f\" , \"size\" : \"1000\" , \"created_at\" : \"2017-07-05T07:54:40.982Z\" , \"manifest\" : { /* ... */ } } }, { // ... } ], \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 2 , \"next_cursor\" : \"...\" } } GET /registry/:app \u00b6 Get an application object by slug.

Technically, it is made with the Content Security Policy. These rules are very strict and it would be a pity to now allow a client side app to load public informations from a source like Wikipedia. Our proposal is to make client side apps able to query external websites of their choices, but these requests will be made via the cozy-stack (as a proxy) and will be logged to check later that no personal data was leaked unintentionally. We can see the data loaded from the external website as a document with a doctype: it\u2019s just not a doctype local to our cozy, but a remote one. A client side app can request data from external websites by doing these three steps: Declaring a remote doctype and its requests Declaring permissions on these doctypes in the manifest Calling the /remote API of cozy-stack Declaring a remote doctype \u00b6 Doctypes are formalized in this repository: github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes . Each doctype has its own directory inside the repository. For a remote doctype, it will include a file called request that will describe how the cozy-stack will request the external website. Let\u2019s take an example: $ tree cozy-doctypes cozy-doctypes \u251c\u2500\u2500 [ ... ] \u251c\u2500\u2500 org.wikidata.entity \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 request \u2514\u2500\u2500 org.wikidata.search \u2514\u2500\u2500 request $ cat cozy-doctypes/org.wikidata.entity/request GET https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/ {{ entity }} .json Accept: application/json $ cat cozy-doctypes/org.wikidata.search/request GET https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action = wbsearchentities & search ={{ q }} & language = en & format = json Here, we have two remote doctypes. Each one has a request defined for it.

Some templating helpers are available to escape specific variables using {{ function name - space - variable name }} . These helpers are only available for the body part of the template. Available helpers: json : for json parts ( { \"key\": \"{{json val}}\" } ) html : for html parts ( <p>{{html val}}</p> ) query : for query parameter of a url ( http://foobar.com?q={{query q}} ) path : for path component of a url ( http://foobar.com/{{path p}} ) Values injected in the URL are automatically URI-escaped based on the part they are included in: namely as a query parameter or as a path component. Note : by default, the User-Agent is set to a default value (\u201ccozy-stack\u201d and a version number). It can be overriden in the request description.

It can use the query-string for GET, and a JSON body for POST, to give values for the variables. Example: GET /remote/org.wikidata.search?q=Douglas+Adams HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.cozy.tools It is possible to send some extra informations, to make it easier to understand the request. If no variable in the request matches it, it won\u2019t be send to the remote website. Example: POST /remote/org.example HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.cozy.tools Content-Type : application/json { \"query\" : \"Qbhtynf Nqnzf\" , \"comment\" : \"query is rot13 for Douglas Adams\" } Note : currently, only the response with a content-type that is an image, JSON or XML are accepted. Other content-types are blocked the time to evaluate if they are useful and their security implication (javascript is probably not something we want to allow). GET /remote/assets/:asset-name \u00b6 The client application can fetch a list of predefined assets via this route. The resources available are defined in the configuration file. Example: GET /remote/assets/bank HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.cozy.tools Logs \u00b6 The requests are logged as the io.cozy.remote.requests doctype, with the doctype asked, the parameter (even those that have not been used, like comment in the previous example), and the application that has made the request. For developers \u00b6 If you are a developer and you want to use a new remote doctype, it can be difficult to first make it available in the github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes repository and only then test it. So, the cozy-stack serve command will have a --doctypes option to gives a local directory with the doctypes.

We can see the data loaded from the external website as a document with a doctype: it\u2019s just not a doctype local to our cozy, but a remote one.

But it\u2019s very important to take in account the possible behaviour of the user. That means that adding a text to explain him/her the consequences of a click on a button can increase the security a lot much than forcing him/her to do things. For example, forcing users to change regulary their password makes them choose passwords that are a lot weaker (but easier for them to remember). Defense in depth is still worthy \u00b6 Also known as layered defense, defense in depth is a security principle where single points of complete compromise are eliminated or mitigated by the incorporation of a series or multiple layers of security safeguards and risk-mitigation countermeasures.

Always sanitizing inputs is a good pratice that improves security, but has also some nice effects like helping developers discover hidden bugs. Encryption is not the solution to all the problems, but it helps \u00b6 Some data are encrypted before being saved in CouchDB (passwords for the accounts for example).

Having more encrypted data can globally weaken the encryption, if it\u2019s not handled properly. If the encryption key is lost or a bug happen, the data is lost with no way to recover them. So, we are more confortable to encrypt only some fields. And later, when we will have more experience and feedbacks from the user, extend the encryption to more fields. We are also working with SMIS , a research lab, to find a way to securely store and backup the encryption keys. Use standards (https, OAuth2) \u00b6 Standards like https and OAuth2 had a lot of eyes to look at them, and are therefore more robust. Reinventing the wheel can be valuable for some things.

An error on the installation can have dramatic effects, like the database being leaked on internet. So, we need to really take care of the devops experience.

PUT /settings/instance/auth_mode \u00b6 With this route, the user can ask for the activation of different authentication modes, like two-factor authentication. Available authentication modes: basic : basic authentication only with passphrase two_factor_mail : authentication with passphrase and validation with a code sent via email to the user. When asking for activation of the two-factor authentication, a side-effect can be triggered to send the user its code (via email for instance), and the activation not being effective. This side-effect should provide the user with a code that can be used to finalize the activation of the two-factor authentication. Hence, this route has two behaviors: the code is not provided: the route is a side effect to ask for the activation of 2FA, and a code is sent the code is provided, and valid: the two-factor authentication is actually activated.

Feature flags \u00b6 A feature flag is a name and an associated value (boolean, number, string or a JSON) that can be interpreted by the apps. It can be used for giving access to paid features, or to enable a feature progressively on all the cozy instances of a context. The stack computes the feature flags from several sources (in order of decreasing priority): the flags set on the instance by the command cozy-stack feature flags the response of the manager for GET /api/v1/flags?sets=s1,s2&context=ctx (where s1,s2 has been set via cozy-stack feature sets ) the flags coming from the context configuration ( context.<name>.features ) the flags set on the context by the command cozy-stack feature ratio the default value ( cozy-stack feature default ). For a given flag, the stack takes the value from the source with the highest priority, and does not look at the other sources (no merge). GET /settings/flags \u00b6 This endpoint returns the computed list of feature flags for the given instance. It accepts an include parameter in the query string to see the details of how the flags were computed.

A user can preview a sharing before accepting it if the application supports this option. Else, he/she will have only the description and rules to make his/her mind about accepting or refusing the sharing. The data is duplicated: it is both on the owner\u2019s cozy, and on the recipients\u2019 cozy (no cloud federation like NextCloud). The applications say what is shared, the stack synchronizes that. The stack does the low-level stuff and gives primitives to the applications. The applications must use them in a responsible manner, and in particular, to avoid transitivity issues. The CouchDB replication will be used to synchronize the documents. It means that the documents will be same on the owner and on the recipients (\u201csymetric sharing\u201d). For files and folders, the replicator will be customized to handle the specificities of the io.cozy.files doctype. The applications must be able to work with broken relationships between documents. The applications should know how to deal with CouchDB conflicts. At least, the default choice of a winner for conflicts by CouchDB should be acceptable if the applications don\u2019t do anything to detect and resolve conflicts. First safety principle: when a user B accepts a sharing from user A, the documents that were on the user B\u2019s cozy before the sharing are not sent to user A without an explicit action of user B (like moving a file to a shared directory). Second safety principle: when two users, A and B, are sharing documents, a change of a document on the user A\u2019s cozy can\u2019t make an exiting document of user B enter in the sharing. Setup of a sharing \u00b6 Step 1: the owner creates the sharing \u00b6 One person decides to share something with other people from an application on her cozy. In our example, Alice wants to share a todo list with her friends, Bob and Charlie, and it is done from the Todo application. The application calls the stack with the rules for this sharing and the identifiers of the contacts with whom to share. The stack persists an io.cozy.sharings document and sends an email to the recipients (Bob an Charlie). Step 2: a recipient accepts the sharing \u00b6 A recipient, let\u2019s say Bob, receives the email and clicks on the link. His browser shows him the Todo application on Alice\u2019s Cozy so that he can preview the todo list, and a modal asks him if he wants to continue the sharing acceptation workflow. If he does, a form will ask him what is the address of his Cozy (the form can be pre-filled if he has already accepted another sharing in the past). After he has filled the form and submitted it, he is redirected on his Cozy. If he is not logged in, he has to login first. Then, a page describes him how the sharing will work and what technical permissions it implies. It also asks him to confirm the sharing. If he accepts, his instance will send to Alice\u2019s instance the answer. Step 3: the initial replication starts \u00b6 Alice\u2019s Cozy instance creates token and sends them with other informations as the response of the answer request from Bob\u2019s instance. At this moment, both instances are ready to start to replicate data to the other instances. So, let\u2019s do the initial replication. Alice\u2019s instance starts to fill the io.cozy.shared database with all the documents that match a rule of the sharing (except the rules with local: true ), and create triggers for the future documents to be also added in this database (the exact triggers depend of the parameters of the rules). And, when done, it creates a job for the replicator, and setups a trigger for future changes in the io.cozy.shared start a replicator job. Bob\u2019s instance also checks if any document matches a sharing rule. In most cases, it won\u2019t. But in some very special cases (e.g. a previous revoked sharing on the same documents), there are some documents that match a rule. They are added to the io.cozy.shared database, but with a conflict flag. They won\u2019t be replicated unless Bob accepts to in his Todo application. Triggers are also added on Bob\u2019s instance for filling the io.cozy.shared database, and to call the replicator after that. Note: there will be a lock around the initial filling of the io.cozy.shared database to avoid concurrency issues if two recipients accept the sharing at the same time. Workflow \u00b6 Step 1: a todo item is added on Bob\u2019s Cozy, a trigger is fired and it adds the new document to the io.cozy.shared database Step 2: a debounced trigger on the io.cozy.shared database is used to start a replicator Step 3: the replicator does the following steps it queries a local document of the io.cozy.shared database to get the last sequence number of a successful replication with this sequence number, it requests the changes feed of io.cozy.shared with a filter on the sharing id the results is a list of document doctype + id + rev that is sent to Alice\u2019s Cozy Alice\u2019s Cozy checks which revisions are known, and send a response with the list of those that are not for each not known revision, Bob\u2019s Cozy send the document to Alice\u2019s Cozy (in bulk) and, if it\u2019s all good, it persists the new sequence number in the local document, as a start point for the next replication Step 4: the changes are put in the io.cozy.shared database on Alice\u2019s Cozy Step 5: it starts a replicator on Alice\u2019s Cozy Step 6: the replicator send the changes to Charlie\u2019s Cozy, all the cozy instances are synchronized again! Note: when a todo item is moved fron a shared todo list to a not shared todo list, the document in io.cozy.shared for the todo item is kept, and the sharing id is associated to the keyword removed inside it. The remove behavior of the sharing rule is then applied. Files and folders \u00b6 Why are they special? \u00b6 Files are special for several reasons. First and foremost, they have a binary attached to them that can be quite heavy. The stack also enforces some rules on them (e.g. a file can\u2019t be added to a deleted folder) and has some specific code for the tree nature of files and folders (e.g. a permission on a folder is inherited on all the files and folders inside it, even if they are several levels below). Thus, the workflow explained just before is not compatible with the files. As we need to introduce some code specific to the files, we have also wanted to improve the sharing of files. First, we don\u2019t want to force the recipients to put the shared folder at exactly the same place as the owner. In fact, we think that putting the shared folder in a folder called Shared with me is more friendly. We also think that a file that has been shared in the past but is no longer (the sharing has been revoked) can evolve on both the owner\u2019s cozy and on the recipients\u2019 cozy in different ways, and in such a case, it\u2019s more logical to consider them as different files. These two reasons implies, on a technical level, that the identifiers for files and folders are not the same on the owner and the recipients of a sharing. The replicator will translate the identifiers from one system to another during the replications. Of course, it will also translate the id in the sharing rules, and the dir_id to preserve the relationship between a file and its parent folder. The path attribute will be seen as a cache, and recomputed when a cozy instance receives a folder document from a sharing replication. We will continue to have a replication as close to the CouchDB replication as possible. It means we synchronize a state, and not looking for the history of operations like cozy-desktop does. It is less accurate and can lead more often to conflicts. The cozy instances are expected to be online most of the time and have a short delay for replications: we think that the conflicts will happen only on rares occasions. This make acceptable to take this shortcut. And, in case of conflicts, we will preserve the content of the files (no data loss), even if it means duplicating the files. How a sharing involving files works? \u00b6 When a sharing involves a rule on the io.cozy.files doctype, a folder is created on the recipients cozy where the files will be put. It is created inside the Shared with me folder by default, but can be moved somewhere else after that. The folder won\u2019t be synchronized its-self later, and if the folder is trashed, the sharing is automatically revoked. As it is not a reversible action, a confirmation is asked before doing that. Note: we will forbid the sharing of the root of the virtual file system, of the trash and trashed files/folders, and of the Shared with me folder. The step 3 described above, aka the replicator, will be more complicated for folders and files. First change, it will work on two phases: 1. what can be synchronized without transfering the binaries first, and 2. the synchronization of files with a binary attached. Second change, the replicator will acquire the Virtual File System lock on the cozy instance where it will write things to ensure the consistency of what it writes. Third change, before inserting a folder or file in the database, the replicator checks that its parent exists, and if it\u2019s not the case, it creates it. Last change, we will avoid CouchDB conflicts for files and folder by using a special conflict resolution process. Sequence diagram \u00b6 Conflict resolution \u00b6 We have several cases of conflicts: When two cozy instances have modified the same file concurrently Same for a folder When two files or folders are renamed concurrently to the same name inside the same directory When a file or folder is created or updated on cozy instance while the parent directory is trashed concurrently on another cozy instance. For 1. and 2., we will reconciliate the changes except for a file with two versions having a distinct binary (we rely on size and checksum to detect that). In such a case, we create a copy of the file with one version, while keeping the other version in the original file. For 3., we rename the file or folder with the smaller id . For 4., we restore the trashed parent, or recreate it if it the trash was emptied. Conflict with no reconciliation \u00b6 When a file is modified concurrently on two cozy instances, and at least one change involve the content, we can\u2019t reconciliate the modifications. To know which version of the file is the \u201cwinner\u201d and will keep the same identifier, and which version is the \u201closer\u201d and will have a new identifier, we compare the revisions and the higher wins. This conflict is particulary tricky to resolve, with a lot of subcases. In particular, we try to converge to the same revisions on all the instances for the \u201cwinner\u201d file (and for the \u201closer\u201d too). We have 3 sets of attributes for files: size and md5sum (they change when the content has changed) name and dir_id (they change when the file is moved or renamed) created_at , updated_at , tags , referenced_by , etc. For the first two sets, the operation on the Virtual File System will needs to reach the storage (Swift), not just CouchDB. For the third set, it\u2019s easy: we can do the change at the same time as another change, because these attributes are only used in CouchDB. But we can\u2019t do a change on the first two sets at the same time: the Virtual File System can\u2019t update the content and move/rename a file in the same operation. If we needs to do both, it will generate 2 revisions in CouchDB for the file. Note: you can see that using CouchDB-like replication protocol means that we have some replications that can look useless, just some echo to a writing. In fact, it is used to acknowledge the writing and is helpful for conflict resolutions. It may be conter-intuitive, but removing them will harm the stability of the system, even if they do nothing most of the time. Example 1 \u00b6 Here, Alice uploads a file on her Cozy. It creates two revisions for this file (it\u2019s what the Virtual File System does). Then, she shares the directory with this file to her friend Bob. When Bob accepts the sharing, the file is sent to his Cozy, with the same revision (2-2aa). Later, Bob renames the file. It creates a new revision (3-3aa). The change is replicated to Alice\u2019s Cozy. And we have a replication from Alice to Bob to ensure that every thing is fine. Even later, Alice and Bob both renames the file at the same time. It creates a conflict. We have a first replication (from Alice to Bob), but nothing happens on B because the local revision (4-4bb) is greater than the candidate revision (4-4aa) and the content is the same. Just after that, we have a revision on the opposite direction (from Bob to Alice). The candidate revision wins (4-4bb), but for files, we don\u2019t use CouchDB conflict, thus it\u2019s not possible to write a new revision at the same generation (4). The only option is to create a new revision (5-5bb). This revision is then sent to Bob: Bob\u2019s Cozy accepts the new revision even if it has no effect on the file (it was already the good name), just to resolve the conflict. Example 2 \u00b6 Like in the last example, Alice uploads a file and share a directory to Bob with this file, Bob acccepts. But then, several actions are made on the file in a short lapse of time and it generates a difficult conflict: Alice renames the file, and then uploads a new version with cozy-desktop Bob moves the file to a sub-directory. So, when the replication comes, we have two versions of the file with different name, parent directory, and content. The winner is the higher revision (4-4aa). The resolution takes 4 steps: A copy of the file is created from the revision 3-3bb, with the new identifier id2 = XorID(id, 3-3bb). The new content is written on Bob\u2019s Cozy: we can\u2019t use the revisions 3-3aa (same generation as 3-3bb) and 4-4aa (it will mean the conflict is fixed, but it\u2019s not the case, the filenames are still different), so a new revision is used (4-4cc). The file is moved and renamed on Bob\u2019s Cozy, with a next revision (5-5bb).

The data is duplicated: it is both on the owner\u2019s cozy, and on the recipients\u2019 cozy (no cloud federation like NextCloud). The applications say what is shared, the stack synchronizes that. The stack does the low-level stuff and gives primitives to the applications. The applications must use them in a responsible manner, and in particular, to avoid transitivity issues. The CouchDB replication will be used to synchronize the documents. It means that the documents will be same on the owner and on the recipients (\u201csymetric sharing\u201d). For files and folders, the replicator will be customized to handle the specificities of the io.cozy.files doctype. The applications must be able to work with broken relationships between documents. The applications should know how to deal with CouchDB conflicts. At least, the default choice of a winner for conflicts by CouchDB should be acceptable if the applications don\u2019t do anything to detect and resolve conflicts. First safety principle: when a user B accepts a sharing from user A, the documents that were on the user B\u2019s cozy before the sharing are not sent to user A without an explicit action of user B (like moving a file to a shared directory).

First and foremost, they have a binary attached to them that can be quite heavy. The stack also enforces some rules on them (e.g. a file can\u2019t be added to a deleted folder) and has some specific code for the tree nature of files and folders (e.g. a permission on a folder is inherited on all the files and folders inside it, even if they are several levels below). Thus, the workflow explained just before is not compatible with the files. As we need to introduce some code specific to the files, we have also wanted to improve the sharing of files. First, we don\u2019t want to force the recipients to put the shared folder at exactly the same place as the owner. In fact, we think that putting the shared folder in a folder called Shared with me is more friendly. We also think that a file that has been shared in the past but is no longer (the sharing has been revoked) can evolve on both the owner\u2019s cozy and on the recipients\u2019 cozy in different ways, and in such a case, it\u2019s more logical to consider them as different files. These two reasons implies, on a technical level, that the identifiers for files and folders are not the same on the owner and the recipients of a sharing. The replicator will translate the identifiers from one system to another during the replications. Of course, it will also translate the id in the sharing rules, and the dir_id to preserve the relationship between a file and its parent folder. The path attribute will be seen as a cache, and recomputed when a cozy instance receives a folder document from a sharing replication. We will continue to have a replication as close to the CouchDB replication as possible. It means we synchronize a state, and not looking for the history of operations like cozy-desktop does. It is less accurate and can lead more often to conflicts. The cozy instances are expected to be online most of the time and have a short delay for replications: we think that the conflicts will happen only on rares occasions. This make acceptable to take this shortcut. And, in case of conflicts, we will preserve the content of the files (no data loss), even if it means duplicating the files.","title":"Why are they special?"},{"location":"cozy-stack/sharing-design/#how-a-sharing-involving-files-works","text":"When a sharing involves a rule on the io.cozy.files doctype, a folder is created on the recipients cozy where the files will be put. It is created inside the Shared with me folder by default, but can be moved somewhere else after that. The folder won\u2019t be synchronized its-self later, and if the folder is trashed, the sharing is automatically revoked. As it is not a reversible action, a confirmation is asked before doing that. Note: we will forbid the sharing of the root of the virtual file system, of the trash and trashed files/folders, and of the Shared with me folder. The step 3 described above, aka the replicator, will be more complicated for folders and files. First change, it will work on two phases: 1. what can be synchronized without transfering the binaries first, and 2. the synchronization of files with a binary attached. Second change, the replicator will acquire the Virtual File System lock on the cozy instance where it will write things to ensure the consistency of what it writes. Third change, before inserting a folder or file in the database, the replicator checks that its parent exists, and if it\u2019s not the case, it creates it.

For 1. and 2., we will reconciliate the changes except for a file with two versions having a distinct binary (we rely on size and checksum to detect that). In such a case, we create a copy of the file with one version, while keeping the other version in the original file. For 3., we rename the file or folder with the smaller id . For 4., we restore the trashed parent, or recreate it if it the trash was emptied.","title":"Conflict resolution"},{"location":"cozy-stack/sharing-design/#conflict-with-no-reconciliation","text":"When a file is modified concurrently on two cozy instances, and at least one change involve the content, we can\u2019t reconciliate the modifications. To know which version of the file is the \u201cwinner\u201d and will keep the same identifier, and which version is the \u201closer\u201d and will have a new identifier, we compare the revisions and the higher wins. This conflict is particulary tricky to resolve, with a lot of subcases. In particular, we try to converge to the same revisions on all the instances for the \u201cwinner\u201d file (and for the \u201closer\u201d too). We have 3 sets of attributes for files: size and md5sum (they change when the content has changed) name and dir_id (they change when the file is moved or renamed) created_at , updated_at , tags , referenced_by , etc. For the first two sets, the operation on the Virtual File System will needs to reach the storage (Swift), not just CouchDB. For the third set, it\u2019s easy: we can do the change at the same time as another change, because these attributes are only used in CouchDB. But we can\u2019t do a change on the first two sets at the same time: the Virtual File System can\u2019t update the content and move/rename a file in the same operation. If we needs to do both, it will generate 2 revisions in CouchDB for the file. Note: you can see that using CouchDB-like replication protocol means that we have some replications that can look useless, just some echo to a writing. In fact, it is used to acknowledge the writing and is helpful for conflict resolutions. It may be conter-intuitive, but removing them will harm the stability of the system, even if they do nothing most of the time.","title":"Conflict with no reconciliation"},{"location":"cozy-stack/sharing-design/#example-1","text":"Here, Alice uploads a file on her Cozy.

The change is replicated to Alice\u2019s Cozy. And we have a replication from Alice to Bob to ensure that every thing is fine. Even later, Alice and Bob both renames the file at the same time. It creates a conflict. We have a first replication (from Alice to Bob), but nothing happens on B because the local revision (4-4bb) is greater than the candidate revision (4-4aa) and the content is the same. Just after that, we have a revision on the opposite direction (from Bob to Alice). The candidate revision wins (4-4bb), but for files, we don\u2019t use CouchDB conflict, thus it\u2019s not possible to write a new revision at the same generation (4).

Sharing by links \u00b6 A client-side application can propose sharing by links: The application must have a public route in its manifest. See Apps documentation for how to do that. The application can create a set of permissions for the shared documents, with codes. Another code called shortcode is also generated and associated with the code. This shortcode is much smaller (but secure), which is easier to be shared. See permissions documentation for the details. The application can then create a shareable link (e.g. https://calendar.cozy.example.net/public?sharecode=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y ) by putting together the app sub-domain, the public route path, and a code for the permissions set. The app can then send this link by mail, via the jobs system , or just give it to the user, so he can transmit it to her friends via chat or other ways. When someone opens the shared link, the stack will load the public route, find the corresponding index.html file, and replace {{.Token}} inside it by a token with the same set of permissions that sharecode offers. This token can then be used as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for requests to the stack (or via cozy-client-js). NB: The shortcode can also be used as the Bearer . In this case, the corresponding sharecode will be matched on server-side If necessary, the application can list the permissions for the token by calling /permissions/self with this token.

The recipients will receive a link to the application subdomain, on this page, and with a sharecode in the query string (like for a share by link). To know the sharing-id , it\u2019s possible to ask GET /permissions/self , with the sharecode in the Authorization header (it\u2019s a JWT token). In the response, the source_id field will be io.cozy.sharings/<sharing-id> . Parameters \u00b6 Parameter Description sharecode a code that identify the recipient url the URL of the Cozy for the recipient Example \u00b6 POST /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/discovery HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded Accept : application/json sharecode=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJhcHAiLCJpYXQiOjE1MjAzNDM4NTc&url=https://bob.example.net/ HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type : application/json { \"redirect\" : \"https://bob.example.net/auth/sharing?...\" } GET /sharings/:sharing-id \u00b6 Get the information about a sharing. This includes the content of the rules, the members, as well as the already shared documents for this sharing. For a member, we can have the following fields: a contact name ( name ), that is the name of this user as it appears in its contact document (if there is one such document) a public name ( public_name ), that is the name this user has put on his cozy as a public name (it is used for sending emails for example) an email addresse ( email ) an instance URL ( instance ) and a status ( status ). Notes: the first member is always the sharer to display the list of members to a user, the name should be use if available, and if it is not the case, you can use the public_name or the email on a recipient, the only member with an instance is the local user.

The application can then create a shareable link (e.g. https://calendar.cozy.example.net/public?sharecode=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y ) by putting together the app sub-domain, the public route path, and a code for the permissions set. The app can then send this link by mail, via the jobs system , or just give it to the user, so he can transmit it to her friends via chat or other ways. When someone opens the shared link, the stack will load the public route, find the corresponding index.html file, and replace {{.Token}} inside it by a token with the same set of permissions that sharecode offers. This token can then be used as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for requests to the stack (or via cozy-client-js). NB: The shortcode can also be used as the Bearer .

It describes their input arguments object. See the jobs document to know more about the API context in which you can see how to use these arguments. log worker \u00b6 The log worker will just print in the log file the job sent to it. It can useful for debugging for example. thumbnail worker \u00b6 The thumbnail worker is used internally by the stack to generate thumbnails from the image files of a cozy instance. konnector worker \u00b6 The konnector worker is used to execute JS code that collects files and data from external providers, and put them in the Cozy. Its execution is detailed on the Konnector Worker specs . service worker \u00b6 The service worker is used to process background jobs, generally to compute non-realtime user data. push worker \u00b6 The push worker can be used to send push-notifications to a user\u2019s device. The options are: client_id : the ID of the oauth client to push a notification to. title : the title of the notification message : the content of the notification data : key-value string map for additional metadata (optional) priority : the notification priority: high or normal (optional) topic : the topic identifier of the notification (optional) sound : a sound associated with the notification (optional) Example \u00b6 { \"client_id\" : \"abcdef123123123\" , \"title\" : \"My Notification\" , \"message\" : \"My notification content.\" , \"priority\" : \"high\" } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission. It is done by adding this to the manifest: { \"permissions\" : { \"push-notification\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to send notifications\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"POST\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"push\" ] } } } unzip worker \u00b6 The unzip worker can take a zip archive from the VFS, and will unzip the files inside it to a directory of the VFS. The options are: zip : the ID of the zip file destination : the ID of the directory where the files will be unzipped. Example \u00b6 { \"zip\" : \"8737b5d6-51b6-11e7-9194-bf5b64b3bc9e\" , \"destination\" : \"88750a84-51b6-11e7-ba90-4f0b1cb62b7b\" } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission.

The options are: files : a map with the the files to zip (their path in the zip as key, their VFS identifier as value) dir_id : the directory identifier where the zip archive will be put filename : the name of the zip archive. Example \u00b6 { \"files\" : { \"selection/one.pdf\" : \"36abc4c0-90fe-11e9-b05b-1fa43ca781ef\" , \"selection/two.pdf\" : \"36eb54c8-90fe-11e9-aeca-03ddc3acf91c\" , \"selection/three.pdf\" : \"37284586-90fe-11e9-be6d-179f72076e43\" , \"selection/four.pdf\" : \"37655462-90fe-11e9-9059-8739e3746720\" , \"selection/five.pdf\" : \"379fedfc-90fe-11e9-849f-0bbe172eba5f\" }, \"dir_id\" : \"3657ce9c-90fe-11e9-b40b-33baf841bcb8\" , \"filename\" : \"selection.zip\" } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission.

It implies that the stack has properly configured an access to an SMTP server. You can see an example of configuration in the cozy.example.yaml file at the root of this repository. sendmail options fields are the following: mode : string specifying the mode of the send: noreply to send a notification mail to the user from to send a mail from the user to : list of object {name, email} representing the addresses of the recipients.

It is done by adding this to the manifest: { \"permissions\" : { \"mail-from-the-user\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to send mails from the user to his/her friends\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"POST\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"sendmail\" ] } } } export \u00b6 The export worker can be used to generate allow the export of all data contained in the cozy. At the end of the export, a mail is sent to the user containing a link to access to its data. The progress of the export process can be followed with realtime events on the doctype io.cozy.exports . Its options are: parts_size : the size in bytes of the sizes index splitting done for multi-part download of files data max_age : the maximum age duration of the archive before it expires with_doctypes : list of string for a whitelist of doctypes to exports (exports all doctypes if empty) without_files : boolean to avoid exporting the index (preventing download file data) Example \u00b6 { \"parts_size\" : 52428800 , \"max_age\" : 60000000000 , // 1 minute \"with_doctypes\" : [ \"io.cozy.accounts\" ], // empty or null means all doctypes \"without_files\" : false } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission. It is done by adding this to the manifest: { \"permissions\" : { \"mail-from-the-user\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to create a export of the user's data\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"POST\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"export\" ] } } } trash-files worker \u00b6 This worker is used only by the stack: when the user asks to clean the trash, the stack will delete the files from CouchDB and put a job for this worker. The deletion of files in Swift is slow, and can be done via this worker asynchronously. The behavior is not the same for all the VFS: afero: all the work is done during the HTTP request, no job is pushed Swift layout v1: all the work is done during the HTTP request, no job is pushed Swift layout v2: the files are deleted in CouchDB during the HTTP request, and they are deleted in Swift via the job Swift layout v3: the files are deleted in CouchDB during the HTTP request, the file versions are deleted in CouchDB via the job, and the files and their versions are deleted in Swift via the job. share workers \u00b6 The stack have 3 workers to power the sharings (internal usage only): share-track , to update the io.cozy.shared database share-replicate , to start a replicator for most documents share-upload , to upload files Share-track \u00b6 The message is composed of 3 fields: the sharing ID, the rule index, and the doctype. The event is similar to a realtime event: a verb, a document, and optionaly the old version of this document. Share-replicate and share-upload \u00b6 The message is composed of a sharing ID and a count of the number of errors (i.e. the number of times this job was retried). notes-save \u00b6 This is another worker for the interal usage of the stack. It allows to write to the VFS a note in an asynchronous way. Writing to the VFS after each tiny change would kill the performance for realtime collaboration, so the stack writes the note to a cache, and has a trigger with debounce to persist the note to the VFS later. migrations \u00b6 The migrations worker can be used to migrate a cozy instance. Currently, it has a single option, type , with two supported values: * to-swift-v3 : migrate a cozy instance that has files in swift from a V1 or V2 layout to a V3 layout * accounts-to-organization : create ciphers from accounts , re-encrypted with the organization key * notes-mime-type : update the notes mime-type to text/vnd.cozy.note+markdown to allow them to be listed in the cozy-notes application. Example \u00b6 It can be launched from command-line with: $ cozy-stack jobs run migrations --domain example.mycozy.cloud --json '{\"type\": \"to-swift-v3\"}' Deprecated workers \u00b6 updates \u00b6 The updates worker was used for updating applications when there were no auto-update mechanism.","title":" /jobs - Workers"},{"location":"cozy-stack/workers/#workers","text":"This page list all the currently available workers on the cozy-stack.

Cozy Stack Architecture \u00b6 What is Cozy? \u00b6 Cozy is a personal platform as a service with a focus on data. Cozy can be seen as 4 layers, from inside to outside: A place to keep your personal data A core API to handle the data Your web apps, and also the mobile & desktop clients A coherent User Experience. It\u2019s also a set of values: Simple, Versatile, Yours. These values mean a lot for Cozy in all aspects. From an architectural point of view, it declines to: Simple to deploy and understand, not built as a galaxy of optimized microservices managed by kubernetes that only experts can debug. Versatile, can be hosted on a Raspberry Pi for geeks to massive scale on multiple servers by specialized hosting. Users can install apps. Yours, you own your data and you control it. If you want to take back your data to go elsewhere, you can. Overview \u00b6 The architecture of Cozy is composed of: A reverse proxy The cozy stack A CouchDB instance to persist the JSON documents A space for storing files Optionally, Redis for caching and synchronization Optionally, a metrics server. All of this can run on a personal server, self-hosted at home, like a Raspberry Pi: But it\u2019s also possible to deploy a cozy on a more powerful server in order to host dozens of cozy instances (an association for example). It will looks like this: And even to scale to thousands of cozy instances on a server farm, with high availability: This elasticity comes with some constraints: Most applications are run in the browser, not in the server. What must run on the server is mutualized inside the cozy stack. The cozy stack is stateless. The data is stored in couchdb and a space for files. A couchdb database is specific to an instance (no mix of data from 2 users in the same database). Reverse proxy \u00b6 The reverse proxy is here to accept HTTPS connexions and forward the request to the cozy stack. It\u2019s here mainly to manage the TLS part and binding a port < 1024 without needing to launch the cozy stack as root. And it\u2019s better if http/2 is supported, as it will make the web interface to load faster. The Cozy Stack \u00b6 The Cozy Stack is a single executable. It can do several things but its most important usage is starting an HTTP server to serve as an API for all the services of Cozy, from authentication to real-time events. This API can be used on several domains. Each domain is a cozy instance for a specific user (\u201cmulti-tenant\u201d). Redis \u00b6 Redis is optional when there is a single cozy stack running. When available, it is used to synchronize the Cozy Stacks: distributed locks for special operations like installing an application, queues for recurrent jobs, etc. As a bonus, it can also be used to cache some frequently used documents. Databases \u00b6 The JSON documents that represent the users data are stored in CouchDB, but they are not mixed in a single database. We don\u2019t mix data from 2 users in the same database. It\u2019s easier and safer to control the access to the data by using different databases per user. But we think to go even further by splitting the data of a user in several databases, one per document type. For example, we can have a database for the emails of a user and one for her todo list. This can simplify the implementation of permissions (this app has access to these document types) and can improve performance. CouchDB queries work with views. A view is defined ahead of its usage and is built by CouchDB when it is requested and is stale, i.e. there were writes in the database since the last time it was updated. So, with a single database per user, it\u2019s possible to experience lag when the todolist view is requested after fetching a long list of emails. By splitting the databases per doctypes, we gain on two fronts: The views are updated less frequently, only when documents of the matching doctypes are written. Some views are no longer necessary: those to access documents of a specific doctypes. There are downsides, mostly: It can be harder to manage more databases. It\u2019s no longer possible to use a single view for documents from doctypes that are no longer in the same database. We think that we can work on that and the pros will outweigh the cons. Metrics \u00b6 The Cozy Stack can generate some metrics about its usage (the size of the files transfered, the number of opened connexions, the number of requests to redis, etc.) and export them to a metrics backend. It will help identify the bottlenecks when scaling to add more users. The Warp 10 Platform looks like a good candidate for this. Glossary \u00b6 Instance \u00b6 An instance is a logical space owned by a user and identified by a domain. For example, zoe.cozycloud.cc can be the cozy instance of Zo\u00e9. This instance has a space for storing files and some CouchDB databases for storing the documents of its owner. Environment \u00b6 When creating an instance, it\u2019s possible to give an environment, dev , test or prod . The default apps won\u2019t be the same on all environments. For example, in the dev environment, some devtools will be installed to help the front developers to create their own apps. Cozy Stack Build Mode \u00b6 The cozy stack can run in several modes, set by a UNIX environment variable: production , the default development , for coding on the cozy stack. This mode is set when compiling the cozy-stack. It is used to show more or less logs, and what is acceptable to be displayed in errors. Even if the Cozy Stack Build Mode and Environment have similar values, they are not the same. The Cozy Stack Mode will be used by core developers to hack on the cozy stack. The environment will be used by front developers to hack on cozy apps. Services \u00b6 The cozy stack came with several services. They run on the server, inside the golang process and have an HTTP interface. Authentication /auth \u00b6 The cozy stack can authenticate the owner of a cozy instance. This can happen in the classical web style, with a form and a cookie, but also with OAuth2 for remote interactions like cozy-mobile and cozy-desktop. Applications /apps \u00b6 It\u2019s possible to manage serverless applications from the cozy stack and serve them via cozy stack. The stack does the routing and serve the HTML and the assets for the applications. The assets of the applications are installed in the virtual file system. On the big instances, it means that even if it is the frontal 1 that installs the application, frontal 2 will still be able to serve the application by getting its assets from Swift. It will be possible to install applications from several sources (git, mercurial, npm or even just a tarball). Also, we want to offer two channels for our official apps: one with a stable and well tested release, and one with more frequent updates for our more adventurous users. More informations here . Data System /data \u00b6 CouchDB is used for persistence of JSON documents. The data service is a layer on top of it for routing the requests to the corresponding CouchDB database and checking the permissions. In particular, a serverless application can declare some contexts and access data in those contexts even if it\u2019s not the owner of the cozy instance that access it. For example, the owner of a cozy can create a photo album with a selection of photos. This album can then be associated to a context to be shared with friends of the owner. These friends can access the album and see the photos, but not anonymous people. More informations here . Virtual File System /files \u00b6 It\u2019s possible to store files on the cozy, including binary ones like photos and movies, thanks to the virtual file system. It\u2019s a facade, with several implementations, depending on where the files are effectively stored: In a directory of a local file system (easier for self-hosted users) Swift from Open Stack (convenient for massive hosting) And more storage providers, like minio , later. The range of possible operations with this endpoint goes from simple ones, like uploading a file, to more complex ones, like renaming a folder. It also ensure that an instance is not exceeding its quota, and keeps a trash to recover files recently deleted. More informations here . Sharing /sharings \u00b6 Users will want to share things like calendars. This service is there for sharing JSON documents between cozy instances, with respect to the access control. Jobs /jobs \u00b6 The cozy stack has queues where job descriptions can be put. For example, a job can be to fetch the latest bills from a specific provider. These queues can be consumed by external workers to complete the associated jobs. We can imagine having a media worker that extract thumbnails from photos and videos. It will fetch jobs from a media queue and each job description will contain the path to the photo or video from which the thumbnail will be extracted. There is also a scheduler that acts like a crontab. It can add jobs at recurrent time. For example, it can add a job for fetching github commits every hour. Later, we can dream about having more ways to create jobs (webhooks, on document creation) and make them communicate. With a web interface on that, it can become a simplified Ifttt . Sync /sync \u00b6 This endpoint will be for synchronizing your contacts and calendars by using standard methods like caldav and carddav. Later, we hope to support also Webdav and RemoteStorage. Settings /settings \u00b6 Each cozy instance has some settings, like its domain name, its language, the name of its owner, the background for the home, etc. Notifications /notifications \u00b6 The applications can put some notifications for the user. That goes from a reminder for a meeting in 10 minutes to a suggestion to update your app. Real-time /realtime \u00b6 This endpoint can be used to subscribe for real-time events. An application that shows items of a specific doctype can listen for this doctype to be notified of all the changes for this doctype. For example, the calendar app can listen for all the events and if a synchronization with the mobile adds a new event, the app will be notified and can show this new event. Error catcher /errors \u00b6 Client-side applications can have some JS errors. By sending the error, with its backtrace, to this endpoint, it will be kept in a logfile to help the developers debug the application later. We should look at the airbrake API and probably be compatible with it to avoid redeveloping JS code to send the errors. Proxy /proxy \u00b6 It can be useful for client-side apps to get data from public APIs. But, sometimes, these APIs don\u2019t have CORS enabled. A proxy endpoint can be a simple but effective solution for these cases. Status /status \u00b6 It\u2019s here just to say that the API is up and that it can access the CouchDB databases, for debugging and monitoring purposes. Workers \u00b6 The workers take jobs from the queues and process them. Fetch emails /jobs/mailbox \u00b6 It fetches a mailbox to synchronize it and see if there are some new emails. Payload: the mailbox Send email /jobs/sendmail \u00b6 It connects to the SMTP server to send an email. Payload: mail account, recipient, body, attachments Extract metadata /jobs/metadata \u00b6 When a file is added or updated, this worker will extract its metadata (EXIF for an image, id3 for a music, etc.) Payload: the filepath Konnectors /jobs/konnector \u00b6 It synchronizes an account on a remote service (fetch bills for example). Payload: the kind of konnector, the credentials of the account and some optional parameters (like the folder where to put the files) Registry /jobs/registry \u00b6 It updates the list of available applications. Payload: none Indexer /jobs/indexer \u00b6 When a JSON document is added, updated or deleted, this worker will update the index for full text search. Bleve looks like a good candidate for the indexing and full text search technology. Payload: the doctype and the document to index Serverless apps \u00b6 Home /apps/home \u00b6 It\u2019s where you land on your cozy and launch your apps. Having widgets to display informations would be nice too! Store (was marketplace) /apps/store \u00b6 You can install new apps here. Settings (was My apps) /apps/settings \u00b6 It\u2019s a list of your installed apps and devices, and you can configure some settings like your email address. Collect (was konnectors) /apps/collect \u00b6 You can configure new accounts, to fetch data from them, and see the already configured accounts. Devtools /apps/devtools \u00b6 Some tools for the developpers of applications only: an API console, documentation, logs of the permission checks, etc. Contacts /apps/contacts \u00b6 Manage your contact books. Calendar /apps/calendar \u00b6 Manage your events and alarms. Drive /apps/drive \u00b6 A web interface to browse your files. Photos /apps/photos \u00b6 Organize your photos and share them with friends. Todo list /apps/todo \u00b6 A task manager to never forgot what you should do. Onboarding /apps/onboarding \u00b6 Start your cozy and setup your accounts. Clients \u00b6 Mobile \u00b6 Cozy-mobile is an application for android and iOS for synchronizing files, contacts and calendars between the phone and the cozy instance. Desktop \u00b6 Cozy-desktop is a client for Linux, OSX and windows that allows to sync the files in a cozy instance with a laptop or desktop. Guidelines \u00b6 The Go Programming Language \u00b6 Go (often referred as golang) is an open source programming language created at Google in 2007. It has nice properties for our usage: Simplicity (the language can be learned in weeks, not years). A focus on productivity. Good performance. A good support of concurrency with channels and goroutines. Moreover, Go is used by a lot of companies , is in the Top 10 of the most used languages and has some known open source projects: docker, kubernetes, grafana, syncthing, influxdb, caddy, etc. And it works on the ARM platforms . Go has some tools to help the developers to format its code ( go fmt ), retrieve and install external packages ( go get ), display documentation ( godoc ), check for potential errors with static analysis ( go vet ), etc. Most of them can be used via gometalinter , which is nice for continuous integration. So, we think that writing the Cozy Stack in Go is the right choice.

When known standards make sense (caldav & carddav for example), use them. Else, JSON API is a good default. The golang web framework used for the cozy stack is Echo . HTTP status codes \u00b6 There are some HTTP status codes that are generally used in the API: 200 OK, when everything is OK 201 Created, when a resource was created 204 No Content, when a resource was deleted 400 Bad Request, when the request has some unknown parameters and the request body is not in the expected format 401 Unauthorized, when the user is not authenticated 403 Forbidden, when the permissions forbid this action 404 Not Found, when the resouce can\u2019t be found 500 Internal Server Error, when a bug occurs 503 Service Unavailable, when the stack, CouchDB, Redis or Swift is unavailable. DocTypes \u00b6 Each JSON document saved in CouchDB has a field docType that identify the kind of thing it is. For example, a contact will have the docType io.cozy.contacts , and in the cozy-doctypes repository, there will be a contacts JSON file inside it that describes this doctype: What are the mandatory and optional fields? What is the type (string, integer, date) of the fields? Is there a validation rule for a field? How the fields can be indexed for full text search? What is the role of each field (documentation)? This description can be used by any cozy client library (JS, Golang, etc.) to generate some models to simplify the use of documents of this doctype. When a docType has a lot of logic (calendar events for example), a JS class should be shared between the several client-side apps that use this docType, in order to avoid recoding this logic in each application. Import and export \u00b6 You will stay because you can leave. An important promise of Cozy is to give back to the users the control of their data. And this promise is not complete with a way to export the data to use it somewhere else. The Cozy Stack will offer an export button that gives a tarball to the user with the full data. She can then import it on another instance for example. It should also be possible to use the data outside of Cozy. So, the format for the tarball should be as simple as possible and be documented. Of course, when it\u2019s possible, we will use open formats. How to contribute? \u00b6 Cozy\u2019s DNA is fundamentally Open Source and we want our community to thrive. Having contributions (code, design, translations) is important for us and we will try to create the favorable conditions to support it. Adding a new konnector \u00b6 Adding a konnector is easy for someone who knows JavaScript. The repository has already a lot of pull requests by external contributors. The wiki has documentation to explain the first steps of creating a new konnector. 3 active contributors have been promoted to the maintainers team and can merge the pull requests. We have done workshops to help new developers code their first konnector and we will keep doing it. Creating a new application \u00b6 One of the goals of the new architecture is to make it easier for developers to write new apps. It means having a good documentation, but also some devtools to help: The cozy executable will have a command to setup a new project. The devtools on the cozy interface will give documentation about the doctypes, help explore the Rest API, and check if the permissions are OK. cozy-ui will make it easy to reuse some widgets and offer an application with a style coherent to the cozy identity. Some docTypes with heavy logic will be available as JS classes to be reused in the apps. Reporting a bug or suggesting a new feature \u00b6 We are listening to our users. The forum is here to discuss on many subjects, including how the applications are used. The issues on github are a good place for bug tracking. Translating to a new language \u00b6 We will keep having internationalization for our applications and the translations are maintained on transifex by the community. Translating to a new language, or reviewing an existing one, is really appreciated. FAQ \u00b6 Does the current konnectors in nodejs will be lost? No, they won\u2019t. The business logic to scrap data from the many sources will be kept and they will be adapted to fit in this new architecture. It is explained how we will do that here . So, it\u2019s not possible to have a custom application with a server part, like the lounge IRC client? We want to support this use case, just not on the short term. It\u2019s not clear how we can do that (while not weakening the security). One idea is to run the applications in a different server, or maybe in docker. How to install and update cozy? The Cozy Stack will have no auto-update mechanism. For installing and updating it, you can use the classical ways: Using a package manager, like apt for debian & ubuntu. Using an official image for Raspberry Pi (and other embedded platforms). Using the image and services of an hosting company. Or compiling and installing it manually if you are really brave ;-) How to add a cozy instance to a farm? Choose a (sub-)domain and configure the DNS for this (sub-)domain. Configure the reverse-proxy to accept this (sub-)domain. Use the cozy executable to configure the cozy stack. How to migrate from the nodejs cozy to this new architecture for cozy? Export the data from the nodejs cozy (we need to add a button in the web interface for that in the coming months). Install the new cozy. Import the data. Please note that we don\u2019t support a continuous replication method that will enable to use both the nodejs and the new architecture at the same time. It looks too complicated for a temporary thing. How to backup the data? There are 2 sensitive places with data: In CouchDB. on the place used for the Virtual File System (a directory on the local filesystem, or in Swift). You can use the tools of your choice to backup these 2 locations. The good old rsync works fine (CouchDB files are append-only, except when compaction happens, so it\u2019s friendly to rsync). It\u2019s highly recommended to have an automated backup, but sometimes it can be useful to have a way to backup manually the data. The \u201cexport data\u201d button in the web interface give a tarball that can be used to transfer your data from one instance to another, and so, it can be used as a backup. Aren\u2019t microservices better for scaling? Yes, it\u2019s often easier to scale by separating concerns, and microservices is a way to achieve that. But, it has some serious downsides: It takes more memory and it\u2019s probably a no-go for Raspberry Pi. It\u2019s more complicated for a developper to install the whole stack before coding its application. It\u2019s harder to deploy in production. For the scalability, we can also deploy some specialized instances of the Cozy Stack. For example, we can have some Cozy Stack processes dedicated for real-time. Even, if they have all the code, we can route only the relevant trafic from the load-balancer. What are the frameworks and tools used for the front-end apps? If you want to develop your own app, you can use the framework and the tools you like, nothing is mandatory. For the official apps, we will want to move to: es2017 (but converting the existing coffeescript code will take time) npm scripts and webpack preact & JSX. More about this here When will this new architecture be available?

It will looks like this: And even to scale to thousands of cozy instances on a server farm, with high availability: This elasticity comes with some constraints: Most applications are run in the browser, not in the server.

We don\u2019t mix data from 2 users in the same database. It\u2019s easier and safer to control the access to the data by using different databases per user. But we think to go even further by splitting the data of a user in several databases, one per document type. For example, we can have a database for the emails of a user and one for her todo list. This can simplify the implementation of permissions (this app has access to these document types) and can improve performance. CouchDB queries work with views. A view is defined ahead of its usage and is built by CouchDB when it is requested and is stale, i.e. there were writes in the database since the last time it was updated. So, with a single database per user, it\u2019s possible to experience lag when the todolist view is requested after fetching a long list of emails. By splitting the databases per doctypes, we gain on two fronts: The views are updated less frequently, only when documents of the matching doctypes are written. Some views are no longer necessary: those to access documents of a specific doctypes. There are downsides, mostly: It can be harder to manage more databases.

The Cozy Stack will have no auto-update mechanism. For installing and updating it, you can use the classical ways: Using a package manager, like apt for debian & ubuntu. Using an official image for Raspberry Pi (and other embedded platforms). Using the image and services of an hosting company. Or compiling and installing it manually if you are really brave ;-) How to add a cozy instance to a farm? Choose a (sub-)domain and configure the DNS for this (sub-)domain. Configure the reverse-proxy to accept this (sub-)domain. Use the cozy executable to configure the cozy stack. How to migrate from the nodejs cozy to this new architecture for cozy? Export the data from the nodejs cozy (we need to add a button in the web interface for that in the coming months). Install the new cozy. Import the data. Please note that we don\u2019t support a continuous replication method that will enable to use both the nodejs and the new architecture at the same time. It looks too complicated for a temporary thing. How to backup the data? There are 2 sensitive places with data: In CouchDB. on the place used for the Virtual File System (a directory on the local filesystem, or in Swift). You can use the tools of your choice to backup these 2 locations. The good old rsync works fine (CouchDB files are append-only, except when compaction happens, so it\u2019s friendly to rsync). It\u2019s highly recommended to have an automated backup, but sometimes it can be useful to have a way to backup manually the data. The \u201cexport data\u201d button in the web interface give a tarball that can be used to transfer your data from one instance to another, and so, it can be used as a backup. Aren\u2019t microservices better for scaling? Yes, it\u2019s often easier to scale by separating concerns, and microservices is a way to achieve that. But, it has some serious downsides: It takes more memory and it\u2019s probably a no-go for Raspberry Pi. It\u2019s more complicated for a developper to install the whole stack before coding its application. It\u2019s harder to deploy in production. For the scalability, we can also deploy some specialized instances of the Cozy Stack. For example, we can have some Cozy Stack processes dedicated for real-time. Even, if they have all the code, we can route only the relevant trafic from the load-balancer. What are the frameworks and tools used for the front-end apps? If you want to develop your own app, you can use the framework and the tools you like, nothing is mandatory. For the official apps, we will want to move to: es2017 (but converting the existing coffeescript code will take time) npm scripts and webpack preact & JSX. More about this here When will this new architecture be available? The roadmap for Cozy v3 has been explained on our blog: https://blog.cozycloud.cc/post/2016/11/21/On-the-road-to-Cozy-version-3","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"cozy-stack/archives/couchdb-plugins/","text":"Table of contents This document was written in october 2016.

Konnectors \u00b6 :warning: Note: this documentation is outdated. It is kept for historical reasons and shows the design and trade-offs we have made initially. But a lot of things have changed since, so don\u2019t expect the things to be still the same. What we want ? \u00b6 Konnectors is an application for Cozy v2 that fetch data from different web sites and services, and save them into a Cozy. The 50+ connectors represent a lot of work from the community. So, we want to port it to Cozy v3. There will be 2 parts: My Accounts, a client-side app, that will offer the possibility for the user to configure her accounts, and choose when to start the import of data (see the architecture doc ). Konnectors, a worker for the job service , with the code to import data from the web sites. Security \u00b6 The risks \u00b6 Konnectors is not just a random application. It\u2019s a very good target for attacks on Cozy because of these specificities: It run on the server, where there is no Content Security Policy, or firewall to protect the stack. It has access to Internet, by design. It is written in nodejs, with a lot of dependencies where it is easy to hide malicious code. It is a collection of connectors written by a lot of people. We welcome these contributions, but it also means that we take into account that we can\u2019t review in depth all the contributions. Access to couchdb \u00b6 The stack has the admin credentials of couchdb. If a rogue code can read its configuration file or intercept connexions between the stack and couchdb, it will have access to couchdb with the admin credentials, and can do anything on couchdb. Access to the stack \u00b6 An attacker can try to profit of konnectors for accessing the stack. It can target the port 6060, used by the stack to manage the cozy instances. Or, it can use its privileged position for timing attacks on passwords. Spying other connectors \u00b6 A rogue connector may try to spy other connectors to pick the credentials for external web sites. It can be done by reading the environment variables or ptracing them. DoS \u00b6 A connector can use a lot of CPU, Ram, or generate a lot of disk I/O to make a deny of service on the server. The connector can remove files on the server to make konnectors stop working. Exploiting the CPU or the bandwidth \u00b6 The resources of the server can be seen as valuable: the CPU can be used for bitcoins mining. The bandwidth can be used for DDoS of an external target. Sending spam \u00b6 Profit of the configured SMTP server to send spams. Be root \u00b6 Row hammer can be a way to gain root access on a server. Possible measures \u00b6 Permissions \u00b6 We can forbid the konnectors to speak directly with couchdb, and pass by the stack for that. And use the permissions to restrict what each konnectors can do with the cozy-stack. ignore-scripts for npm/yarn \u00b6 Npm and yarn can execute scripts defined in package.json when installing nodejs dependencies. We can use the ignore-scripts option to disable this behaviour. Forbid addons in nodejs \u00b6 Nodejs can require addons , ie C/C++ compiled libraries. I\u2019ve found no flag to disable the install of such modules for npm/yarn, and no flag for nodejs to prevent loading them. We can try to detect and remove such modules just after the installation of node modules. They should have a .node extension. Note : not having a compiler on the server is not enough. Npm can install precompiled modules. vm/sandbox for Nodejs \u00b6 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node\u2019s built-in modules. Mock net \u00b6 We can mock the net module of nodejs to add some restrictions on what it can do. For example, we can check that it does only http/https, and blacklist connection to localhost:6060. It is only effective if the konnector has no way to start a new node processus. Timeout \u00b6 If a konnector takes too long, after a timeout, it should be killed. It implies that the cozy-stacks supervises the konnectors. Chroot \u00b6 Chroot is a UNIX syscall that makes an application see only a part of the file-system. In particular, we can remove access to /proc and /sys by not mounting them, and limit access to /dev to just /dev/null , /dev/zero , and /dev/random by symlinks them. Executing as another user \u00b6 We can create UNIX users that will just serve to execute the konnectors, and nothing else. It\u2019s a nice way to give more isolation, but it means that we have to find a way to execute the konnectors: either run the cozy-stack as root, or have a daemon that launches the konnectors. Ulimit & Prlimit \u00b6 ulimit provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control. It can be used to linit the number of processes (protection against fork bombs), or the memory that can be used. prlimit can do the same for just one command (technically, for a new session, not the current one). Linux namespaces \u00b6 One feature Linux provides here is namespaces. There are a bunch of different kinds: in a pid namespace you become PID 1 and then your children are other processes. All the other programs are gone in a networking namespace you can run programs on any port you want without it conflicting with what\u2019s already running in a mount namespace you can mount and unmount filesystems without it affecting the host filesystem. So you can have a totally different set of devices mounted (usually less). It turns out that making namespaces is totally easy! You can just run a program called unshare . Source: What even is a container, by Julia Evans Cgroups \u00b6 cgroups (abbreviated from control groups) is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes. Seccomp BPF \u00b6 Seccomp BPF is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. Isolation in a docker \u00b6 Isode is a 3 years old project that aims to isolate nodejs apps in docker containers. A possibility would be to follow this path and isolate the konnectors inside docker. It\u2019s a real burden for administrators. And its command line options often changes from one version to another, making difficult to deploy something reliable for self-hosted users. So we will try to avoid it. Isolation in docker contains is mostly a combination of Linux Namespaces, Cgroups, and Seccomp BPF. There are other options with those (see below). Rkt \u00b6 Rkt is a security-minded, standard-based container engine. It is similar to Docker, but Docker needs running a daemon whereas rkt can be launched from command-line with no daemon. NsJail / FireJail \u00b6 NsJail and FireJail are two tools that use Linux Namespaces and Seccomp BPF to reduce the risks to run untrusted applications on Linux. FireJail seems to be more suited for graphical apps, and NsJail for networking services. NaCl / ZeroVM \u00b6 ZeroVM is an open source virtualization technology that is based on the Chromium Native Client (NaCl) project. ZeroVM creates a secure and isolated execution environment which can run a single thread or application. But NaCl is no longer maintained and ZeroVM has some severe limitations, so, it won\u2019t be used. Konnector isolation study \u00b6 The short list of tools which will be tested to isolate connectors is Rkt and NsJail which on paper better fullfill our needs. NsJail \u00b6 NsJail is a lightweight process isolation tool, making use of Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf syscall filters. It is not a container tool like docker. Its features are quite extensive regarding isolation. The README gives the full list of available options. Although available in the google github, it is not an official google tool. NsJail is: easy to install : just a make away with standard build tools offers a full list or isolation tools lightly documented the only documentation is nsjail -h (also available in the main github page) and it is quite cryptic for a non-sysadmin like me. I could not find any help in any search engine. Some examples are available to run a back in an isolated process and work but I could not run a full nodejs (only nodejs -v worked) The konnectors will need a full nodejs installed on the host Is still actively maintained Rkt \u00b6 Rkt is very similar to docker. It can even directly run docker images from the docker registry, which gives us a lot of existing images to use, even if we want to be able to use other languages than node. For example, we could have also a container dedicated to weboob, another container could use phantomjs or casper and without forcing self-hosted users to do complicated installation procedures. Rkt is : easy to install : debian, rpm package available, archlinux community package : https://github.com/coreos/rkt/releases has network isolation like docker offers CPU, memory limitation, seccomp isolation (but the set of rules to use is out of my understanding) is well documented , complete man pages, but not as well known as docker, then there is not a lot of things to find outside the official documentation. can use docker image directly or can convert them to one runnable aci file with one simple cli command (rkt export) is in active developpement but relatively stable regarding core features. container images can be easily signed and the signature is checked by default when running a container. I managed to run a nodejs container with just the following commands : rkt run --insecure-options=image --interactive docker://node:slim --name nodeslim -- -v rkt list # to get the container uuid rkt export --app=nodeslim <uuid> nodeslim.aci rkt run --insecure-options=image --interactive nodeslim.aci -- -v # to run node -v in the new container Note: the \u2013insecure-options param is to avoid the check of the image signature to ease the demonstration Choice \u00b6 The best choice would be Rkt for it\u2019s ease of use (which is good for contribution) and wide range of isolation features + access to the big docker ecosystem without beeing a burden for the host administrator. Note : the limitation of NsJail I saw might be due to my lack of knowledge regarding system administration. Proposed use of rkt regarding connectors \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 As stated before, rkt is easy to install. It may also be possible to make it available in the cozy-stack docker image but I did not test it (TODO) Image creation \u00b6 To create an ACI file image, you just need to run a docker image one time : rkt run --uuid-file-save=$PWD/uuid --insecure-options=image --interactive docker://node:slim --name nodeslim -- -v rkt export --app=nodeslim `cat uuid` nodeslim.aci && rm uuid The node:slim image weights 84M at this time. The node:alpine image also exists and is way lighter (19M) but I had problems with DNS with this, and alpine can cause some nasty bugs that are difficult to track. Running a connector \u00b6 A path dedicated to run the konnectors with a predefined list of node packages available (the net module could be mocked with special limitations to blacklist some urls) A script will run the node container giving as option the script to launch. The path is mounted inside the container. The following script does just that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #!/usr/bin/env bash rm -rf ./container_dir cp -r ./container_dir_template ./container_dir rkt run --net = host --environment = CREDENTIAL = value ; COZY_URL = url --uuid-file-save = $PWD /uuid --volume data,kind = host,source = $PWD /container_dir --insecure-options = image nodeslim.aci --cpu = 100m --memory = 128M --name rktnode --mount volume = data,target = /usr/src/app --exec node -- /usr/src/app/ $1 $2 & # the container will handle itself the communication with the stack sleep 60 rkt stop --force --uuid-file = uuid rkt rm --uuid-file = uuid rm -rf ./container_dir This script can be run like this : ./rkt.sh mynewkonnector.js If the mynewkonnector.js file is available in the container_dir_template directory. Cons : must forbid access to port 5984 and 6060 + SMTP server The limitation of time, CPU and memory will avoid most DOS attacks (to my knowledge). For memory use, I still don\u2019t see a way to prevent the excessive use of swap from the container. To prevent the connectors from listening to each other, they should be run in containers with different uid, avoiding them to listen to each other. Solution to limit access of the container to 5984 and 6060 ports + SMTP \u00b6 The container must be started in bridged mode. With that, the container still has access to localhost but through a specific IP address visible with ifconfig. That way, the host can have iptable rules to forbid access to specified ports to the bridge. To connect a container in bridge mode : On the host create the file /etc/rkt/net.d/10-containers.conf { \"name\": \"bridge\", \"type\": \"bridge\", \"bridge\": \"rkt-bridge-nat\", \"ipMasq\": true, \"isGateway\": true, \"ipam\": { \"type\": \"host-local\", \"subnet\": \"10.2.0.0/24\", \"routes\": [ { \"dst\": \"0.0.0.0/0\" } ] } } and run your container with the \u201c\u2013net=bridge\u201d option. That way, a new interface is available in the container and gives you access to the host. Konnector install and run details \u00b6 Install \u00b6 The konnectors will be installed in the .cozy_konnectors directory which is in the VFS using git clone (like the apps at the moment). The konnectors installation may be triggered when the user says he wants to use it. The resulting repository is then kept for each run of the konnector. It may then be given to the user the possibility to upgrade the konnector to the latest version if any. To update a given konnector, a git pull command is run on the konnector. Details about running a konnector \u00b6 To run a given konnector, the stack will copy this connector in a \u201crun\u201d directory, which is not in the VFS. This directory will be given to the rocket container as the current working directory with full read and write access on it. This is where the container will put its logs and any temp file needed. There will be also cozy-client.js and the shared libraries in a lib directory inside this directory. The lib directory will be the content of the actual server lib directory . The konnector will be run with the following environment variables : COZY_CREDENTIALS : containing the response to Oauth request as json string COZY_URL : to know what instance is running the konnector COZY_FIELDS : as a json string with all the values from the account associated to the konnector. COZY_PARAMETERS : optional json string associated with the application, used to parameterize a konnector based on a common set of code. In the end of the konnector execution (or timeout), the logs are read in the log.txt file and added to the konnector own log file (in VFS) and the run directory is then destroyed. Multi-account handling \u00b6 This section is devoted to allow the user to use one account for multiple konnectors. It will follow the following constraints in mind: The migration path must be as easy as possible The developpement and maintainance of konnector must also be as easy as possible New doctype : io.cozy.accounts \u00b6 A new doctype will have to be created to allow to keep konnector accounts independently from each konnector.

Realtime design \u00b6 Context \u00b6 Definitions \u00b6 Event: Something happening in the stack. Most of them will come from couchdb, some jobs and user actions might also trigger them. Events feed: the feed of occurring events. There is two types of feeds: continuous allows to follow events as they occurs interval allow the see the history of the feed from any given time Realtime: user experienced updates of the interface from change happening from another source. Ie, I have a folder opened in cozy-files on the browser, I take some pictures from my smartphone, the pictures appears in the folder without me needing to refresh the browser tab. What couchdb offers \u00b6 Couchdb supports with its _changes API both events feeds types: using since=now&continuous=true we get all events continuous ly as they happen (SSE) using since=(last known seq_number) we get all changes in the interval between last known seq_number and now. Couchdb also offers a _db_updates route, which give us continuous changes at the database level. This routes does not support a since parameter, as there is no global seq_number . Other events will be generated from the stack itself, such as session close or jobs activity. Performance limitation \u00b6 We cannot have a continuous _changes feed open to every databases Use cases for interval events feeds \u00b6 Replication \u00b6 Couchdb replication algorithm can work in one-shot mode, where it replicates changes since last sync up until now, or in continuous mode where it replicates changes as they happens. The stack will not allow continuous mode for replication. This is already supported with the _changes route Sharing \u00b6 Our sharing is based on couchdb replication rules, so also depends on _changes feed to ensure all changes have been applied.

CouchDB replication is a well-understood, safe and stable algorithm ensuring replication between two couchdb databases. It is delta-based, and is stateful: we sync changes since a given checkpoint. Files synchronization \u00b6 Replication of too heavy database (with a lot of attachments) has been, in cozy experience, the source of some bugs. To avoid that (and some other issues), in cozy-stack, the attachments are stored outside of couchdb. This means we need a way to synchronize files in parallel to couchdb replication. Rsync is a well-understood, safe and stable algorithm to replicate files hierarchy from one hosts to the other by only transfering changes. It is one-shot and stateless. It could be an inspiration if we have to focus on syncing small changes to big files. The option to use rsync/zsync have been discussed internally (https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/pull/57 & Sprint Start 2016-10-24), but for now we should focus on using the files/folders couchdb document for synchronization purpose and upload/download the actual binaries with existing files routes or considering webdav. Useful golang package: http://rclone.org/ sync folder in FS / Swift (may be we can add a driver for cozy) Couchdb replication & limitation \u00b6 Couchdb 2 replication protocol is described in details here . Quick summary \u00b6 The replicator figures out what was the last sequence number lastseqno which was correctly synced from the source database, using a _local/:replicationid document. The replicator GET :source/changes?since=lastseqno&limit=batchsize and identify which docs have changed (and their open_revs ). The replicator POST :target/_revs_diff to get a list of all revisions of the changed documents the target does not know. The replicator GET :source/:docid?open_revs=['rev1', ...] several times to retrieve the missing documents revisions. The replicator POST :target/_bulk_docs with these documents revisions. Store the new last sequence number Repeat 2-5 until there is no more changes. Details \u00b6 In step 5, the replicator can also attempt to PUT :target/:docid if doc are too heavy, but this should not happens in cozy-stack considering there wont be attachment in couchdb. In step 4, the replicator can optimize by calling GET The main difference from couchdb 1.X is in the replication history and the manner to determine and store the last sequence number. TODO: actually understand this and how it might increase disk usage if we have a lot of replications. Couchdb _changes and by extension replication can be either by polling or continuous (SSE / COMET) In couchdb benchmarking, we understood that the number of couch databases only use a bit of disk space but no RAM or CPU as long as the database is not used . Having a continuous replication active force us to keep the database file open and will starve RAM & FD usage. Moreover, continuous replication costs a lot (cf. ScienceTeam benchmark). To permit an unlimited number of inactive user on a single cozy-stack process, the stack should avoid continuous replication from couchdb . Two way replication is simply two one way replications Routes used by replication \u00b6 To be a source of replication, the stack only need to support the following route (and query parameters): GET :source/:docid get revisions of a document. The query parameters open_revs, revs, latest is necessary for replication. POST :source/_all_docs is used by current version of cozy-mobile and pouchdb as an optimization to fetch several document\u2019s revision at once. GET :source/_changes get a list of ID -> New Revision since a given sequence number. The query parameters since, limit are necessary for replication. To be a target of replication, the stack need to support the following routes: POST :target/_revs_diff takes a list of ID -> Rev and returns which one are missing. POST :target/_bulk_docs create several documents at once POST :target/_ensure_full_commit ensure the documents are written to disk. This is useless if couchdb is configured without delayed write (default), but remote couchdb will call, so the stack should return the expected 201 In both case, we need to support PUT :both/_local/:revdocid to store the current sequence number. Stack Sync API exploration \u00b6 Easy part: 1 db/doctype on stack AND remote, no binaries \u00b6 We just need to implement the routes described above by proxying to the underlying couchdb database. var db = new PouchDB ( \"my-local-contacts\" ); db . replicate . from ( \"https://bob.cozycloud.cc/data/contacts\" ); db . replicate . to ( \"https://bob.cozycloud.cc/data/contacts\" ); To suport this we need to: Proxy /data/:doctype/_changes route with since, limit, feed=normal. Refuse all filter parameters with a clear error message. (Doc) Add support of open_revs , revs , latest query parameter to GET /data/:doctype/:docid (Doc) Proxy the /data/:doctype/_revs_diff (Doc) and /data/:doctype/_bulk_docs routes (Doc) routes Have /data/:doctype/_ensure_full_commit (Doc) returns 201 This will cover documents part of the Devices use case. Continuous replication \u00b6 It is impossible to implement it by simply proxying to couchdb (see unlimited inactive users). The current version of cozy-desktop uses it. TODISCUSS It could be replaced by 3-minutes polling without big losses in functionality, eventually with some more triggers based on user activity. The big use case for which we might want it is Sharing. But, because Sharing will (first) be stack to stack, we might imagine having the source of event \u201cping\u201d the remote through a separate route. Conclusion: Start with polling replication. Consider alternative notifications mechanism when the usecase appears and eventually use time-limited continuous replication for a few special case (collaborative edit). Realtime \u00b6 One of the cool feature of cozy apps was how changes are sent to the client in realtime through websocket. However this have a cost: every cozy and every apps open in a browser, even while not used keep one socket open on the server, this is not scalable to thousands of users. Several technology can be used for realtime: Websocket, SSE or COMET like long-polling. Goroutines makes all solution similar performances wise. COMET is a hack, websocket seems more popular and tested (x/net/websocket vs html5-sse-example). SSE is not widely available and has some limitations (headers\u2026) Depending on benchmarking, we can do some optimization on the feed: close feeds when the user is not on screen multiplex different applications\u2019 feed, so each open cozy will only use one socket to the server. This is hard, as all apps live on separate domain, an (hackish) option might be a iframe/SharedWorker bridge. To have some form of couchdb-to-stack continuous changes monitoring, we can monitor _db_udpates (Doc) which gives us an update when a couchdb has changed. We can then perform a _changes query on this database to get the changed docs and proxy that to the stack-to-client change feed. Conclusion: We will use Websocket from the client to the stack. We will try to avoid using continuous changes feed from couchdb to the stack. We will optimize if proven needed by benchmarks, starting with \u201cuseless\u201d changes and eventually some multiplexing. Sharing \u00b6 To be completed by discussing with Science team. Current ideas (as understood by Romain) any filtered replication is unscalable 1 db for all shared docs sharing_db . Cozy-stack is responsible for saving documents that should be shared in both their dg implemented by 2-way replication between the 2 users sharing_db , filtering is done by computing a list of IDs and then doc_ids (sharing with filters/views are not efficient) Sharing is performed by batches regularly. Continuous replication can be considered for collaborative editing. Proposal by Romain, if we find _selector filter replication performances to be acceptable on very large / very old databases. No sharing database A permission, for anything is a mango-style selector. on every query, the Mango selector is checked at the stack or couchdb level ( $and -ing for queries, testing output document, input document) Sharing is a filtered replication between user\u2019s 1 doctypedb et user\u2019s 2 samedoctypedb No continuous replication Upon update, the stack trigger a PUSH replication to its remote or \u201cping\u201d the remote, and the remote perform a normal PULL replication.

The current version of cozy-desktop uses it. TODISCUSS It could be replaced by 3-minutes polling without big losses in functionality, eventually with some more triggers based on user activity. The big use case for which we might want it is Sharing. But, because Sharing will (first) be stack to stack, we might imagine having the source of event \u201cping\u201d the remote through a separate route. Conclusion: Start with polling replication.

However this have a cost: every cozy and every apps open in a browser, even while not used keep one socket open on the server, this is not scalable to thousands of users. Several technology can be used for realtime: Websocket, SSE or COMET like long-polling. Goroutines makes all solution similar performances wise. COMET is a hack, websocket seems more popular and tested (x/net/websocket vs html5-sse-example). SSE is not widely available and has some limitations (headers\u2026) Depending on benchmarking, we can do some optimization on the feed: close feeds when the user is not on screen multiplex different applications\u2019 feed, so each open cozy will only use one socket to the server. This is hard, as all apps live on separate domain, an (hackish) option might be a iframe/SharedWorker bridge. To have some form of couchdb-to-stack continuous changes monitoring, we can monitor _db_udpates (Doc) which gives us an update when a couchdb has changed. We can then perform a _changes query on this database to get the changed docs and proxy that to the stack-to-client change feed. Conclusion: We will use Websocket from the client to the stack. We will try to avoid using continuous changes feed from couchdb to the stack. We will optimize if proven needed by benchmarks, starting with \u201cuseless\u201d changes and eventually some multiplexing.","title":"Realtime"},{"location":"cozy-stack/archives/replication/#sharing","text":"To be completed by discussing with Science team.

Therefore we will use the classical stack: a JavaScript web application and cordova At the end of this documentation , you will find how-tos to help you with cordova configuration , webpack builds and cordova deployments for Android and iOS . To create your first Cozy application , just follow the guide. As you can read there, Cozy applications are served by the Cozy server, this is the way that Cozy applications retrieve a token to query data. In the case of a mobile application, you need to retrieve a token differently. Hopefully we provide everything you need to do it easily. You\u2019ll need two libraries: cozy-client ( source ) cozy-bar ( source ) In the case of Cozy web applications served by the Cozy server, these two libraries are injected in the html file with variables {{.CozyClientJS}} and {{.CozyBar}} . Setup index.html \u00b6 First thing first, add JavaScript libraries files into your index.html : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > mobile Cozy application with Cordova </ title > < script src = \"cozy-client.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"cozy-bar.js\" ></ script > </ head > < body > <!-- page content --> </ body > </ html > Connect to Cozy server \u00b6 When an user will start your mobile Cozy application, she/he will need to point to her/his server url to ask for permissions for her/his device. This is done by our library cozy-client , you just need to add a HTML form: < form id = \"form\" > < label > What is your cozy server url? < input name = \"url\" id = \"url\" type = \"text\" /> </ label > < button type = \"submit\" > Submit </ button > </ form > const urlInput = document . getElementById ( \"url\" ); const form = document . getElementById ( \"form\" ); form . addEventListener ( \"submit\" , registerClient ); function registerClient ( event ) { event . preventDefault (); const url = urlInput . value ; const { client , token } = await cozyClient . register ( url ); // do whatever you need with client and token like persist } JS Bin on jsbin.com When cozyClient.register(url) is called, the cordova inapp browser plugin is used to display a password request and a permission acceptation page to let the end-user to register her/his device. That\u2019s all! Then you can use the cozy-client library as you would within a classic Cozy application . Initialize the Cozy bar \u00b6 The Cozy bar needs some information to be initialized and its initialization must be done in your front-end code: cozy . bar . init ({ appName : \"App Name\" , appEditor : \"Editor Name\" , iconPath : require ( \"./assets/app-icon.svg\" ), lang : \"en-US\" , replaceTitleOnMobile : true }) Use Cordova \u00b6 Install and setup cordova \u00b6 Cordova is a tool to build Android and iOS applications from a web app. It works with a CLI that needs node . Look at the cordova documentation to install everything needed . Once cordova is installed, just run cordova create cozy-app com.example.cozyapp CozyApp and you get the following structure: ./ \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.xml \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 platforms \u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins \u2514\u2500\u2500 www \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.css \u251c\u2500\u2500 img \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 logo.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html \u2514\u2500\u2500 js \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.js 7 directories, 6 files Note: everything you put in www/ will be served as your application content. Configure your build tool \u00b6 If you use a build tool to transpile your JavaScript code, you need to configure your tool to output the build into www/ . webpack configuration \u00b6 As Webpack is the most used build tool we will show you how to configure it with cordova: Create a webpack.config.js on the root folder of your project with: const path = require ( 'path' ); module . exports = { entry : './src/app.js' , output : { filename : 'bundle.js' , path . resolve ( __dirname , 'www' ) } } And add the output bundle in the www/index.html file: < html > < head > ... </ head > < body > ... < script src = \"bundle.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > See the official webpack documentation for more details.

As an example, for the Drive application , it should be ~/cozy/drive/build . Also make sure you have pulled the last version of the Docker image cozy/cozy-app-dev : docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev On GNU/Linux, according to the documentation : \u00ab The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. If you don\u2019t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. Be warned that the docker group grants privileges equivalent to the root user. You should have a look at Docker\u2019s documentation on security . Notice: The default passphrase configured by cozy-stack in the Docker container is cozy . Ephemeral instance \u00b6 To run a ephemeral instance, on the ~/cozy/myapp directory, you have to mount the folder inside the server to /data/cozy-app .

This is what make the application available on the server With data persistence \u00b6 If you want to persist data, you have to mount two folders from the virtual server to local folders: /usr/local/couchdb/data (database) and /data/cozy-storage (the virtual filesystem). This can be achieved by adding to the two command lines with -v which will store the server\u2019s data into ~/cozy/data/ . $ docker run --rm -it \\ -p 8080 :8080 \\ -p 8025 :8025 \\ --name cozydev \\ -v \"~/cozy/myapp\" :/data/cozy-app \\ -v \"~/cozy/data/db\" :/usr/local/couchdb/data \\ -v \"~/cozy/data/storage\" :/data/cozy-storage \\ cozy/cozy-app-dev Run with a custom stack config file \u00b6 The cozy-stack config file can be useful to change the log level for example.

This might be useful for heavy computations or for tasks triggered after some events, typically after data is retrieved through konnectors or mobile/desktop sync, without the user being on the application. In contrast to konnectors, services have the same permissions as the web application and are not intended to collect information from the outside. It is rather meant to asynchronously analyse data inside the cozy and emit some output once the task is done. However, they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they should be executed: via our trigger system . Example \u00b6 You can find an example of an existing service in the cozy-banks app . Service declaration \u00b6 The service must be declared in the app manifest . For example: \"services\" : { \"onOperationCreate\" : { \"type\" : \"node\" , \"file\" : \"onOperationCreate.js\" , \"trigger\" : \"@event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED\" , \"debounce\" : \"3m\" } } Here is an explanation of the fields: type : describe the code type (only node for now). file : the single (packaged) file containing the code to execute as a service. trigger : what triggers the service. It must follow the available triggers described in the jobs documentation . In this example, the trigger is a bank operation creation. debounce (optionnal): force a minimal delay between two runs of the service. m is for minutes and s for seconds. if this parameter is omitted, the service will be executed as soon as it can. Build \u00b6 The service must be packaged into a single file containing all the dependencies. An example of a webpack rule is available here . Note that target: 'node' is important as the service is run as a Node.js process. In this example, the services are built alongside your app using yarn watch . Stack \u00b6 As the service is run on a dedicated process on the server side, a running stack is necessary. You can either use a stack installed with docker or directly from source . Some configuration is required to execute the service and store the produced logs, to facilitate the development. The following instructions are for a stack installed from source, but you can easily adapt it for a docker installation: you just have to download the default config file , modify it as described below and indicate its location through the docker command, as explained here . In the following, we assume that your $HOME is /home/alice, so change accordingly to your own $HOME . Copy the default config file \u00b6 Create a directory ~/.cozy and copy the default configuration file into it.

Development \u00b6 master is the current state of the development. Every commit must: provide a working application without introducing blocking regressions validate lint and unit tests Every feature, improvement or fix is merged via a pull request. For large features with huge impacts on the whole codebase, use feature branches, for example feature/something-new . A feature branch is merged into master when it\u2019s totally functional and validated. Releases \u00b6 TL;DR Create release branch Bump master version Tag beta versions from release branch until it passes all tests Tag stable version from release branch Delete release branch The goal of a release is to have a new stable version of an application or a konnector. A new release is always based on the current state of master , so it consists in creating a new branch release-0.0.0 (with the correct version). Right after starting a new release, master \u2018s version must be bumped, as the previous version is now \u201cfrozen\u201d into the release branch. It is done now to not forget to do it later, or to not have a new unexpected commit before the next version.

Following the previous example: git tag 1 .4.0-beta.1 git push origin 1 .4.0-beta.1 NB: Version number in package.json and manifest.webapp is still 1.4.0 If this beta version is ok, it can be tagged as stable git tag 1 .4.0 git push origin 1 .4.0 But if the beta is not ok, fixes are committed into the release branch and a new beta version is tagged. git tag 1 .4.0-beta.2 git push origin 1 .4.0-beta.2 This process is repeated until a beta version is validated and ready to be tagged as stable. During the release, development continues in master without impacting release-1.4.0 .

The server (Cozy-stack - documentation ) \u00b6 The server consist of a single process. We call it the Cozy stack . The server is in charge of serving the Web applications users have installed from the application store. It provides its services through a REST API that allows to: create, update, delete documents inside the database; authenticate users and client applications; send emails; launch jobs on the server. Connectors that import data from remote websites are some sort of jobs. Jobs can be one time tasks (sending a message) or periodic tasks. Some jobs, like the connectors, that require executing third party code on the server side, are sandboxed (we use nsjail for now). \u2026 The server also allow to access the database replication API, allowing to sync documents between the server and local databases, for example in mobile clients. Two authentication methods are available: Web applications running on the server get a session token when the user log in; OAuth2 for other applications. The database \u00b6 CouchDB is a document database. Everything, from user data to server settings, is stored inside typed documents, identified by an unique id. Two request methods are allowed: map-reduce or Mango , a specific query language. Every document has a doctype , and we keep an index of the definition of every doctype. Binary data are stored outside the database. Depending on the server configuration, they may be stored on a file system or a dedicated object storage like swift .

This API allows to manipulate data and files and to perform miscellaneous tasks, like send emails connectors : Small application written in JavaScript, running on the server, that import your data from remote sources. The server provides services to applications: real time notifications of events; methods allowing applications to communicate and share data; interapps : applications can expose \u201ccapabilities\u201d that other apps can call. For instance an app can expose the capability to pick a photo or to create a contact. methods allowing sharing of documents between servers.

All you need to have is: NodeJS 10+ Yarn : a NodeJS package manager, like npm Docker to have a Cozy for dev Some basics about developing a single page application in HTML/JS or you just want to learn :) Install the development environment \u00b6 The only tool required to have a Cozy for development is Docker. Install Docker for OSX Install Docker for Windows (We have been told that installing Docker on some familial flavours of Windows may be a bit difficult. It has not been tested yet for this documentation.) Install Docker for GNU/linux: Ubuntu / Fedora / Debian / CentOs On GNU/Linux, according to the documentation : \u00ab The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. If you don\u2019t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. Be warned that the docker group grants privileges equivalent to the root user. You should have a look at Docker\u2019s documentation on security . Every application running inside Cozy is a client-side HTML5 application interacting with your data through the API of the server. To develop an application, you\u2019ll require a running Cozy server. The easiest way is to use the Docker image for developers we provide. Just install it: docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev Note We update this image on a regular basis with the latest version of the server and our library. Don\u2019t forget to update the image by running docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev from time to time to keep your Cozy dev up to date. Create your application \u00b6 You can boostrap your application from scratch if you want, but we highly recommand to use our dedicated community tool create-cozy-app to bootstrap very easily a Cozy application for you. This tool will generate an application using React, the framework we internally use in the Cozy Front team. But options are available if you want to use other frameworks. To do so, run directly create-cozy-app without installing it globally by using the yarn create cozy-app command to bootstrap your application: yarn create cozy-app mycozyapp The script will download some dependencies (may take a while) and ask you a few questions, then create an application skeleton inside mycozyapp . Here is a quick demo of what\u2019s happening: That\u2019s it! You can already start developing: cd mycozyapp yarn start This command will run webpack in a watching mode with a server (webpack-dev-server) to serve application assets. a Cozy stack using docker (the image cozy/cozy-app-dev ) to serve your application inside it. The same docker image starts a CouchDB containing your data (be careful, since a data volume is not attached by default, your data will disappear on restart. You should start the docker image manually if you want to persist your data). Your application will be available at http:// .cozy.tools:8080. Password is cozy . In this mode HMR (Hot Module Replacement) is available to help you with the application development. Going Further \u00b6 What is cozy.tools ? \u00b6 You may see in our documentation that we use *.cozy.tools as domain for the local Cozy. Since Cozy uses subdomains to serve the applications, we can\u2019t use directly localhost as it. We have just parameterized this *.cozy.tools domain to always redirect to 127.0.0.1 , your local computer address. With that, no need to configure your environment to set extra local hosts for development anymore. How the application works? \u00b6 The minimal application consist of only two files: an HTML file, index.html , with the markup and the code of your application a manifest describing the application. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp with the name of the application, the permissions it requires\u2026 We\u2019ll have a deeper look to it content later. Your application requires some informations to interact with the server API, for example the URL of its entrypoint, and an auth token. This data will be dynamically injected into index.html when it serves the page. So the index.html file has to contain some string that will be replaced by the server. The general syntax of this variables is {{\u2026}} , so don\u2019t use this syntax for other purpose in the page, for example inside comments. You can use the following variables: {{.Domain}} will be substituted by the URL of the API entrypoint {{.Token}} will be replaced by a token that authenticate your application when accessing the API {{.Locale}} : the lang f the instance {{.AppName}} : the name of the application {{.AppNamePrefix}} : the name prefix of the application {{.AppSlug}} : the slug of the application {{.AppEditor}} : the editor of the application {{.IconPath}} will be replaced by HTML code to display the favicon {{.CozyClientJS}} will be replaced with HTML code to inject the Cozy client library (old Cozy client) {{.CozyBar}} will be replaced with HTML code to inject the upper menu bar {{.ThemeCSS}} will be replaced by the theme.css . It is empty by default, but can be overrided by using contexts . {{.Favicon}} will be replaced by the favicon served by the stack. This allows to get this kind of index.html : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"{{.Locale}}\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > My Awesome App for Cozy </ title > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" > < link rel = \"stylesheet\" src = \"my-app.css\" > {{.ThemeCSS}} {{.CozyClientJS}} {{.CozyBar}} </ head > < body > < div role = \"application\" data-cozy-token = \"{{.Token}}\" data-cozy-stack = \"{{.Domain}}\" > </ div > < script src = \"my-app.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Read the application manifest \u00b6 Each application must have a \u201cmanifest\u201d. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp stored at the root of theapplication directory. It describes the application, the type of documents it uses, the permissions it requires\u2026 Here\u2019s a sample manifest: { \"name\" : \"My Awesome application\" , \"name_prefix\" : \"\" , \"slug\" : \"myapp\" , \"permissions\" : { \"apps\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.apps\" }, \"permissions\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.permissions\" }, \"settings\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.settings\" }, \"sample\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.dev.sample\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" , \"PUT\" , \"PATCH\" , \"DELETE\" ] }, \"jobs\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" } }, \"routes\" : { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true } } } Permissions \u00b6 Applications require permissions to use most of the APIs. Permissions can be described inside the manifest, so theserver can ask the user to grant them during installation. Applications can also request permissions at run time. A permission must at type contain a target, the type of objects the application want to interact with. Can be a document type, or an action on the server. By default, all grant on this object are granted, but we can also request fine grained permissions, for example limiting to read access. We can also limit the scope to a subset of thedocuments. In the manifest, each permission is an object, with a random name and some properties: - type : mandatory the document type or action name - description : a text that will be displayed to the user to explain why the application require this permission - verbs : an array of HTTP verbs. For example, to limit permissions to read access, use [\"GET\"] - selector : a document attribute to limit access to a subset of documents - values : array of allowed values for this attribute. An application can request a token that grant access to a subset of its own permissions. For example if the application has full access to the files, it can obtain a token that give only read access on a file. Thus, the application can make some documents publicly available. The public page of the application will use this token asauthentication token when accessing the API. Samples \u00b6 Application require full access to files: { \"permissions\" : { \"files\" : { \"description\" : \"\u2026\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.files\" }, } } Application want to be able to read the contact informations of cozy@cozycloud.cc { \"permissions\" : { \"contact\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.contacts\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"selector\" : \"email\" , \"values\" : [ \"cozy@cozycloud.cc\" ] } } } Routing \u00b6 The application must declare all of its URLs (routes) inside the manifest. A route is an object associating an URL toan HTML file. Each route has the following properties: folder : the base folder of the route index : the name of the file inside this folder public : a boolean specifying whether the route is public or private (default). Sample: \"routes\" : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/assets\" , \"public\" : true } } Behind the magic \u00b6 Some server APIs may not be available right now through the library. If you want to use one of this method, you\u2019llhave to call it manually. We\u2019ll describe here how to access the API without using the Cozy Client library. Connecting to the API requires three things: its URL, injected into the page through the {{.Domain}} variable the application auth token, injected into the page through the {{.Token}} variable. Each request sent to theserver must include this token in the Authorization header the session cookie, created when you connect to your server. This is an HttpOnly cookie , meaning that JavaScriptapplications can\u2019t read it. This prevent a malicious script to stole the cookie. Here\u2019s a sample code that get API informations provided by the server and query the API: < div data-cozy-token = \"{{.Token}}\" data-cozy-domain = \"{{.Domain}}\" /> document . addEventListener ( 'DOMContentLoaded' , () => { \"use strict\" ; const app = document . querySelector ( '[data-cozy-token]' ); fetch ( `// ${ app . dataset . cozyDomain } /apps` , { method : 'GET' , headers : { Authorization : `Bearer ${ app . dataset . cozyToken } ` // Here we use the auth token }, credentials : 'include' // don\u2019t forget to include the session cookie }) . then ( function ( response ) { if ( response . ok ) { response . json (). then (( result ) => { console . log ( result ); }); } else { throw new Error ( 'Network response was not ok.' ); } }) . catch ( function ( error ) { console . log ( 'There has been a problem with your fetch operation: ' + error . message ); }); }); Handle data with cozy-client \u00b6 cozy-client is a simple and declarative way of managing cozy-stack API calls and resulting data. It is a convenient and powerful way to bind cozy-stack queries to your components. Getting started React integration API docs Discover the Cozy Bar \u00b6 The Cozy Bar is a component that display the Cozy menu on the top of yourapplication and allow inter-apps features like content sharing. Your application interacts with this component through cozy-bar.js , a library injected into your pages by theserver when you add {{.CozyBar}} in the header. It exposes an API behind the window.cozy.bar namespace. Before using it, you have to initialize the library: window.cozy.bar.init({appName: \"Mon application\"}) . Style with Cozy UI \u00b6 If you plan to build a webapp to run on Cozy, you\u2019ll probably want to use a simple and elegant solution to build your interfaces without the mess of dealing with complex markup and CSS. Then Cozy UI is here for you! It relies on Stylus as preprocessor. You can add it as a library in your project to use it out-of-the-box.","title":"Create Your Application"},{"location":"tutorials/app/#prerequisites","text":"Developing an application for Cozy is like developing a front-end JS application.

It provides: cozy-couchdb : CouchDB database engine used by cozy cozy-nsjail : NSJail isolation tool used by konnectors cozy-stack : Cozy core cozy-coclyco : CLI to manage vhosts and certificates cozy : metapackage installing everything to setup a self-hosted environment This repository currently supports: Debian Buster (10.x): amd64 armhf arm64 Raspbian Buster (10.x): armhf Ubuntu Disco (19.04): amd64 armhf arm64 Available channels are: testing : Updated \u00b1 twice a month. cozy-couchdb and cozy-nsjail are temporary packages. They will be removed when official couchdb and nsjail will be available You can choose to install cozy-couchdb on the same host as cozy-stack , or use a remote CouchDB server. Cozy only needs a 2.x CouchDB (1.x not supported). Like CouchDB, you can choose to install your reverse proxy on the same host, or use a remote one. Right now cozy-coclyco supports only local nginx . If you want to use apache2 or remote reverse proxy, you need to manually configure it for vhost or TLS certificate issuances. Prerequisites \u00b6 Third party repositories \u00b6 Cozy requires NodeJS 12, but this version is not available on official distribution repositories. You need to activate NodeSource repository, following the documentation available here Cozy repositories \u00b6 First, install the packages required to install cozy apt install ca-certificates apt-transport-https wget Then, fetch the GPG Cozy signing key: wget https://apt.cozy.io/cozy-keyring.deb dpkg -i cozy-keyring.deb Finally, setup your repository. Select the channel that best fit your needs: For now, we recommend to use testing repositories. stable packages are quite old and currently provide deprecated and unsecured CouchDB version (2.0.x). Adapt your sources.list accordingly. Supported repositories are: Debian Buster (10.x) deb https://apt.cozy.io/debian/ buster testing Raspbian Buster (10.x) deb https://apt.cozy.io/raspbian/ buster testing Ubuntu Disco (19.04) deb https://apt.cozy.io/ubuntu/ disco testing echo \"deb https://apt.cozy.io/debian/ buster testing\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cozy.list apt update Setup \u00b6 For the rest of this document, we assume you install components one by one to allow intermediate verification For a full local environment ( couchdb + nginx + cozy ), just install the cozy package which can install all needed packages in one shot. CouchDB \u00b6 apt install cozy-couchdb Install CouchDB in standalone mode Configure CouchDB to listen on 127.0.0.1 Pick an administrator password (This password is used by shell scripts, so currently avoid to use one with simple or double quotes or others shell meaningfull symbols. We advice you to choose one with only alphanumeric digits to avoid troubles.) At this point, you must have a working CouchDB instance curl http://localhost:5984/ { \"couchdb\" : \"Welcome\" , \"version\" : \"2.1.0\" , \"features\" : [ \"scheduler\" ] , \"vendor\" : { \"name\" : \"The Apache Software Foundation\" }} Cozy stack \u00b6 apt install cozy-stack Cozy need to create a CouchDB administrator and so to connect as admin to the CouchDB.

So pick a new one. When invoking cozy-stack (or cozy-coclyco which use it under the hood), you need to set the COZY_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable with this password. You can put it on your .bashrc for simplier life if you want. If you don\u2019t, cozy-stack will simply ask for it.

The simpliest way to handle this is to use a wildcard entry if supported by your domain hosting. cozy 1h IN A x.x.x.x *.cozy 1h IN CNAME cozy ACME (Let\u2019s Encrypt) \u00b6 Like DNS, each application will use a different sub-domain and so request a certificate which include all needed domains. cozy-coclyco use Let\u2019s Encrypt and it ACME protocol to prove your ownership over the domain you try to issue a certificate. This protocol requires your reverse proxy to be able to serve http://<app>.cozy.example.org/.well-known/acme-challenge/ requests correctly. The simplest way to achieve this is to configure your reverse proxy with a generic rule to forward any /.well-known/acme-challenge/ request to the corresponding /etc /ssl/private/acme-challenge/ folder.

First of all, download or clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/konnectors/cozy-konnector-template cozy-konnector-newservice cd cozy-konnector-newservice rm -rf .git git init yarn install # or npm install note: we use yarn , but if you prefer npm , keep using it, everything should work. The connector is ready to run with sample code. As a demo we will scrape a fictional website: books.toscrape.com , for which you do not need credentials . As indicated in the README.md file, just run: yarn standalone # or npm run standalone The very first run will create a konnector-dev-config.json file that allows you to configure the connector input when executing it with the CLI. This configuration comes from Cozy Home when deployed. { \"COZY_URL\" : \"http://cozy.tools:8080\" , \"fields\" : { // configuration injected to the start function } } The fields property allows you to set credentials for the targeted web service, such as login and password as if they come from Cozy Stack (so from a real Cozy Cloud instance). You can add as many fields as the targeted service needs. The COZY_URL property will be used later. You do not need to change it for now.

The connector will then save data directly into your cozy. This will validate that your manifest has the needed permissions on the data you want to save. Now that we have successfully scraped and saved our data, the next step is to build the connector and send it to Cozy store !","title":"Run the dev mode"},{"location":"tutorials/konnector/scrape-data/","text":"In this part, we are going to see how to scrape data from the service you want to retrieve your data from. If not done yet, you want to check the getting started guide . Implement your connector \u00b6 There are four steps for a connector to save data to Cozy Stack : authentication request data parse and format data save data to cozy stack You can see these steps in the src/index.js in the konnectors/template : async function start ( fields ) { // step 1. log ( 'info' , 'Authenticating ...' ) await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) log ( 'info' , 'Successfully logged in' ) // step 2. // The BaseKonnector instance expects a Promise as return of the function log ( 'info' , 'Fetching the list of documents' ) const $ = await request ( ` ${ baseUrl } /index.html` ) // step 3. log ( 'info' , 'Parsing list of documents' ) const documents = await parseDocuments ( $ ) // step 4. // here we use the saveBills function even if what we fetch are not bills, but this is the most // common case in connectors log ( 'info' , 'Saving data to Cozy' ) await saveBills ( documents , fields . folderPath , { // this is a bank identifier which will be used to link bills to bank operations. These // identifiers should be at least a word found in the title of a bank operation related to this // bill. It is not case sensitive. identifiers : [ 'books' ] }) } Authentication \u00b6 Open the src/index.js file, there are comments to guide you through it. The very first step is to be able to authenticate to the remote service, this is done with the line: note: don\u2019t forget to add your additional fields if you have some. await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) There are many obstacles at this level: is there a captcha? is there a 2FA? how is the <form> ? note: if the remote service exposes an API, you should use classical request call. Let\u2019s say the remote service exposes a simple classical form like https://www.trainline.eu/signin : < form id = \"signin-form\" novalidate = \"\" class = \"signin__form\" data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-680 = \"680\" > < input name = \"email\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Email Address\" id = \"ember691\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"email\" > < input name = \"password\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Password\" id = \"ember696\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"password\" > < div class = \"signin__forgot\" > < span data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-697 = \"697\" > < a href = \"/password\" id = \"ember698\" class = \"ember-view\" > Forgot your password? </ a > </ span > </ div > < div class = \"signin__buttons \" > < div class = \"signin__buttons-block\" > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"signin__button\" > Sign In </ button > </ div > </ div > </ form > Find a CSS selector for the form tag: form#signin-form . Find the name of the input tags used to host user\u2019s credentials: email and password . You are ready to complete the signin(options) object called in the authenticate(username, password) function: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : 'form#signin-form' , formData : { email : username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { // write some code to validate the form submission } }) } To implement the validate function, you need to check what is happening on a successful login and on an unsuccessful login. With the https://www.trainline.eu/signin example, fill the form with wrong credentials, open your browser\u2019s devtools (and check the network tab) and submit the form. Here it is clear, on incorrect credentials, the response have a status code 422 : HTTP/2.0 422 No Reason Phrase Do the same with valid credentials. HTTP/2.0 200 OK Then you can write a simple and straight forward validate code: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : 'form#signin-form' , formData : { email : username , password }, // \"email\" and \"password\" correspond to the `name` attribute of the HTML inputs validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { return statusCode === 200 || log ( 'error' , 'Invalid credentials' ) } }) } However if the target website doesn\u2019t use statusCode correctly you can also use fullResponse.request.uri.href to check if there is a redirection to a page that requires to be logged in: validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) => { return fullResponse . request . uri . href == 'https://example.com/account' || log ( 'error' , 'Invalid credentials' ) } It is also possible to use Cheerio to check if an HTML element is present in the web page or not : validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { return $ ( 'a[href=\"https://example.com/logout\"]' ). length == 1 || log ( 'error' , $ ( '.error' ). text ()) } Request data \u00b6 Once the connector is able to be authenticated by the online service, the next step is to fetch data. The most common case is that the invoices we want to fetch are listed in a HTML page. So to request data, we fetch the target webpage that contains invoices list. But sometimes, the webpage is a JavaScript page that uses a JSON API URL. JSON is easier to parse than full HTML webpages. For the purpose of this guide, let\u2019s consider we are in the case of a full HTML webpage, like the service given as an example in the template: http://books.toscrape.com This is the easiest part, just fetch the webpage: const $ = await request ( 'http://books.toscrape.com/index.html' ) The $ variable is set to a cheerio object with useful API to crawl the webpage . You can name this variable as you want and create as many as you want Cheerio variables such as : $doc or $page . That object will be very useful for the next step. Parse the document \u00b6 We want to get every <article /> of the page in a JavaScript Array: const articles = []. map . call ( $ ( 'article' , node => node )) For every book, we want to catch the title attribute of this tag article h3 a . This is a CSS Selector that cheerio understands to select some part of the tree. In order to crawl a list of items to create an Array of JSON object, we can create our own function or use the function scrape from the connector libs : const docs = scrape ( $ , { title : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' }, amount : { sel : '.price_color' , parse : normalizePrice }, url : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'href' , parse : url => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ url } ` }, fileurl : { sel : 'img' , attr : 'src' , parse : src => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ src } ` }, filename : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' , parse : title => ` ${ title } .jpg` } }, 'article' ) Keep in mind that there are many useful CSS Pseudo-classes and Combinators that you can use in your CSS selectors to help you select HTML elements. This code will loop on <article /> and for each item will create a JSON object with the selector sel and the value of attribute attr if specified, otherwise it takes the value of the child node, this value can be edited with the parse function. Here is a sample for the following markup from http://books.toscrape.com : < article class = \"product_pod\" > < div class = \"image_container\" > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" > < img src = \"media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" alt = \"A Light in the Attic\" class = \"thumbnail\" > </ a > </ div > < p class = \"star-rating Three\" > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > </ p > < h3 > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" title = \"A Light in the Attic\" > A Light in the ... </ a > </ h3 > < div class = \"product_price\" > < p class = \"price_color\" > \u00a351.77 </ p > < p class = \"instock availability\" > < i class = \"icon-ok\" ></ i > In stock </ p > < form > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-primary btn-block\" data-loading-text = \"Adding...\" > Add to basket </ button > </ form > </ div > </ article > And we will get the following JSON object: { \"title\" : \"A Light in the Attic\" , \"amount\" : 51.77 , \"url\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" , \"fileurl\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" , \"filename\" : \"A Light in the Attic.jpg\" } The code sample includes some other function to manipulate the result object, but we have the idea. Once we build a correct object, we can save it to Cozy Stack. fileurl is used to tell Cozy where to find the file (here an image) to retreive. Then you can save it to Cozy Stack (see section below). There are many document types (Doctypes) you can store in your Cozy, such as: Bills Contacts Bank and so on\u2026 Save data to Cozy Stack \u00b6 In the example we use some built-in function to save a bill to the Cozy Stack. But there is a bunch of functions available depending on what you want: addData hydrateAndFilter saveBills to save invoices files (this function use saveFiles ) that can be linked to your bank transactions. saveFiles to upload files to Cozy Drive. and so on\u2026 For example, to save bills to Cozy you have to start by recovering all required fields for a data type io.cozy.bills using the scrape function, and then you can use the function saveBills to save your docs to Cozy Stack as shown below: await saveBills ( documents , fields , { idenditifiers: [ 'vendor' ], // name of the target website contentType: 'application/pdf' }) documents is the list of bills returned by the function parseDocuments after the page scraping . We can find more information in the libs repository . Now that we pass on every steps, it is time to test the connector with yarn standalone . For now, we have not inserted the data in the Cozy, in the next section , you will learn how to plug your connector to your Cozy.","title":"Scrape data"},{"location":"tutorials/konnector/scrape-data/#implement-your-connector","text":"There are four steps for a connector to save data to Cozy Stack : authentication request data parse and format data save data to cozy stack You can see these steps in the src/index.js in the konnectors/template : async function start ( fields ) { // step 1. log ( 'info' , 'Authenticating ...' ) await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) log ( 'info' , 'Successfully logged in' ) // step 2. // The BaseKonnector instance expects a Promise as return of the function log ( 'info' , 'Fetching the list of documents' ) const $ = await request ( ` ${ baseUrl } /index.html` ) // step 3. log ( 'info' , 'Parsing list of documents' ) const documents = await parseDocuments ( $ ) // step 4. // here we use the saveBills function even if what we fetch are not bills, but this is the most // common case in connectors log ( 'info' , 'Saving data to Cozy' ) await saveBills ( documents , fields . folderPath , { // this is a bank identifier which will be used to link bills to bank operations.
